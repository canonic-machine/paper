**The CANONIC Paper Specification**

This document defines **what a paper is** under the CANONIC paradigm, **how it is generated**, and **how its claims are validated**.  
It is not the manuscript. It is the **law governing the manuscript**.

The central claim of this specification is itself empirical:

> **Under CANONIC, the paper is the experiment.**

The system that produces the paper is governed, executed, recorded, and audited. The paper is a reconstruction of that execution. As a result, the paper is self-evidencing: its claims are provable directly from the ledger that produced it.

---

## 1. Ontology of PAPER

PAPER is a **purely epistemic layer**. It has no authority to govern, enforce, or execute. Its sole role is to **observe, reconstruct, and interpret** what occurred under governance.

PAPER exists downstream of:

- **CANON** (law)
- **MACHINE / VALIDATORS** (enforcement)
- **LEDGER (git)** (execution and state)
- **WRITING** (candidate generation)

PAPER does not introduce primitives. It consumes them.

---

## 2. Core Axiom

> **A paper is valid if and only if every claim it makes is traceable to ledger evidence produced under CANONIC governance.**

This axiom is sufficient.

---

## 3. The Paper-as-Experiment Paradigm

Traditional scientific papers describe experiments that occur elsewhere. Under CANONIC, this separation collapses.

- The **system** is governed.
- The **execution** is recorded.
- The **ledger** is authoritative.
- The **paper** reconstructs what happened.

Therefore:

> **The paper is not a report of an experiment. The paper *is* the experiment.**

The hypothesis, method, results, and limitations are all derivable from the same ledger.

---

## 4. Ledger-First Reconstruction

PAPER is constructed by traversing the execution ledger backward:

- Commits define state
- Merges define convergence
- Reverts define rejection
- Episodes define temporal scope

No forward-planned workflow is assumed. No finite-state machine is defined for the paper, because the finite-state machine already exists as the ledger.

> **Git is the state machine. PAPER is the interpretation of its trace.**

## 5. Epistemic Separation of Authority

### 5.1 Governance

Governance flows exclusively through **CANON**.

- CANON defines legality
- CANON defines invariants
- CANON defines vocabulary

PAPER cannot alter governance.

### 5.2 Enforcement

Enforcement flows through **MACHINE and VALIDATORS**.

- States are accepted or rejected
- Invalid transitions cannot persist

PAPER cannot enforce.

### 5.3 Insight

Insight flows exclusively through **PAPER**.

- Observations
- Interpretations
- Design discoveries
- Negative results

Insight has no force of law.

---

## 6. Episodes (Units of Evidence)

Episodes are **human-declared temporal boundaries** that segment execution.

- Episodes span commits
- Episodes may cross repositories
- Episodes preserve confusion, correction, and fixation
- Episodes are immutable once closed

Episodes do not change law. They are evidentiary only.

The paper is derived from episode analysis.

---

## 7. Method (Retrospective and Observational)

The method is fixed and minimal:

- Observe the ledger
- Segment by episodes
- Reconstruct sequences
- Identify patterns
- State claims conservatively

No hidden mechanisms are assumed. Only observable state transitions are admissible evidence.

---

## 8. Claims and Admissibility

A claim is admissible if:

- It is traceable to ledger evidence
- It appears across multiple episodes (unless explicitly labeled anecdotal)
- It is phrased as an observation, not a rule

Claims that sound like law are invalid in PAPER.

---

## 9. Best Practices

Best practices are **derived observations**, not prescriptions.

They:
- May inform future governance
- May be canonified by human decision
- Have no authority within PAPER

---

## 10. Self-Proving Property

Because:

- Governance is explicit
- Execution is recorded
- Evidence is immutable
- Interpretation is constrained

The paper proves itself.

Any reader with access to the ledger can independently reconstruct the experiment and verify the claims.

---

## 11. Scope and Limits

This paper makes no claims about:

- Optimality
- General intelligence
- Model performance
- Universality

It studies **institutional behavior under governance**.

---

## 12. Canonical Statement

> **This paper empirically demonstrates that governed, ledger-first human–LLM systems can produce self-evidencing scientific artifacts, where the paper itself constitutes the experiment it describes.**

---

**This file is the PAPER law.**  
**The manuscript is generated under it.**
