# PAPER

**The CANONIC WRITING MACHINE paper specification.**

This is the specification for the academic paper discovering best practices for writing CANONIC papers. PAPER.md is human-iterated and defines what this paper IS.

---

## Subject

This paper documents the **entire CANONIC WRITING MACHINE stack** - paradigm, machine, and application working together.

**CANONIC** (paradigm) - Constitutional programming via constraints + validation
**WRITING** (machine) - 4-state FSM (Episode → Asset → Prose → Output)
**MACHINE** (semantic methods) - How we govern the stack

**The paper's purpose:** Discover best practices for writing CANONIC papers by analyzing our CANONIC interactions with the GIT MACHINE.

**Method:** Analyze productive and consumptive git commits to extract traceable, robust best practices.

**We don't know the best practices yet.** The paper discovers them through analysis of our own git history.

**Focus:**
- CANONIC paradigm (constraints, validation, triad, inheritance, producer/consumer)
- WRITING machine (4-state FSM, episodes/assets/prose/output)
- GIT MACHINE interactions (productive commits, consumptive commits)
- Constitutional governance (human governance, AI execution)
- Best practices extraction (what works, what fails, patterns that emerge)
- Real-time discovery (insights canonified as we write)

---

## Evidence Requirements

**All claims must trace to git history.**

The paper analyzes git commits from our actual CANONIC paper writing sessions.

Evidence sources:
- PAPER repository commits (this paper's writing sessions)
- WRITING repository commits (machine development)
- CANONIC repository commits (paradigm evolution)
- Producer/consumer commit patterns (legislative process)
- Episodes (episodic memory of sessions)
- Constitutional violations and recoveries (governance in action)
- Maturity metrics computed from git log (evolution measurement)

**No hallucinated claims.** Every assertion must be verifiable by cloning repos and running git commands.

## Structure

Standard academic paper structure:

1. **Abstract** - Contribution (best practices for CANONIC papers), methods (git analysis), findings
2. **Introduction** - Problem (AI slop), solution (CANONIC stack), thesis (git interactions reveal best practices)
3. **Model** - CANONIC paradigm (constraints, triad, inheritance, producer/consumer, git-FSM)
4. **Implementation** - WRITING machine + GIT MACHINE interactions (how we govern the stack)
5. **Results** - Best practices discovered through git analysis (constitutional compliance, maturity metrics, episodes, resets, canonical locality)
6. **Discussion** - What works, what fails, patterns that emerged, implications
7. **Conclusion** - Best practices summary, significance for CANONIC paper writing
8. **References** - Citations to external work

## Key Insights

**The paper must document these insights extracted from git history:**

**Paradigm layer (CANONIC):**
- Constitutional programming via constraints + validation
- Triad requirement (CANON, VOCAB, README - all LLM-generated)
- VOCAB is temporal (evolves with machine, not static dictionary)
- Specifications are human iteration points (CANONIC.md, WRITING.md, PAPER.md)
- Producer/consumer legislative process (maturity measurement)
- Inheritance (implementations inherit from paradigm)

**Machine layer (GIT MACHINE):**
- Git is a machine (not just storage)
- Atomic commits as critical infrastructure (FSM execution log)
- GitHub is the ledger (single source of truth)
- Git signal = FSM execution trace
- One episode spans many commits (producer + consumer sequences)

**Governance:**
- AI-driven, human-governed execution model (governor general metaphor)
- Constitutional compliance through git signal (violations visible, recoverable)
- Human governance catches AI drift (pattern blindness vs constitutional enforcement)
- Real-time canonification (insights captured during execution)

**Application layer (WRITING + PAPER):**
- 4-state FSM (Episode → Asset → Prose → Output)
- Episodes are ungoverned input (fleeting moments, episodic memory)
- Episodes captured in real-time during sessions
- Canonical locality (artifacts placed closest to canon that governs them)
- Self-* properties (self-validating, self-documenting, self-healing, self-measuring, self-optimizing, self-strengthening)

**Best practices (discovered through git analysis):**
- Every session is an episode (capture fleeting moments)
- Form vs governance (file existence ≠ compliance)
- Layer discipline (paradigm vs implementation vs domain)
- Meta-circular writing (paper documents its own creation)

---

## Traceability

Every artifact reference must resolve:
- Repository links → must exist on GitHub
- Commit hashes → must exist in git history
- File paths → must exist at specified commits
- Git commands → must produce stated results
- Metrics → must be computable from git log
- Episodes → must trace to actual sessions

No broken links. No hallucinated references. Complete verifiability.

---

## Meta-Circular Properties

This paper:
- Documents best practices for CANONIC papers
- Is itself a CANONIC paper
- Discovers best practices by analyzing its own writing
- Captures episodes from its own sessions
- Canonifies insights discovered during writing
- Validates its own claims against its own git history
- Demonstrates every pattern it describes

**The paper IS the experiment.** We analyze our CANONIC interactions with the GIT MACHINE to discover what works.
