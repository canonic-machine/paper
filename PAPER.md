# PAPER

**The CANONIC WRITING machine paper specification.**

This is the specification for the academic paper documenting the WRITING machine. PAPER.md is human-iterated and defines what this paper IS.

## Subject

This paper documents the **CANONIC WRITING machine**, not the CANONIC paradigm.

The WRITING machine is a 4-state FSM (Episode → Asset → Prose → Output) that transforms lived experience into durable, traceable prose under constitutional governance.

**Focus:**
- 4-state FSM implementation
- AI-driven, human-governed writing
- Git as underlying machine dependency
- Constitutional writing governance
- Episodes as ungoverned input
- Assets as governed meaning units
- Prose as narrative referencing assets
- Output as validated artifact

**Out of scope:** CANONIC paradigm details beyond what's needed to understand WRITING machine governance.

## Evidence Requirements

**All claims must trace to git history.**

The paper is an analysis of git commits, not theoretical speculation.

Evidence sources:
- WRITING repository commits
- CANONIC repository commits (for inherited constraints)
- Producer/consumer commit patterns
- FSM state transitions visible in commit messages
- Constitutional violations and recoveries
- Maturity metrics computed from git log

**No hallucinated claims.** Every assertion must be verifiable by cloning repos and running git commands.

## Structure

Standard academic paper structure:

1. **Abstract** - Contribution, methods, findings (one paragraph)
2. **Introduction** - Problem (AI slop), solution (CANONIC), thesis
3. **Model** - CANONIC paradigm essentials (triad, inheritance, producer/consumer)
4. **Implementation** - WRITING machine (4-state FSM, validation gates, git-FSM)
5. **Results** - Constitutional compliance, git signal, maturity metrics, episodes, resets
6. **Discussion** - Implications, limitations, future work
7. **Conclusion** - Summary and significance
8. **References** - Citations to external work

## Key Insights

**The paper must document these insights extracted from git history:**

- Git is a machine that CANONIC machines depend on (not just storage)
- AI-driven, human-governed execution model (governor general metaphor)
- Atomic commits as critical infrastructure (FSM execution log)
- Layer discipline (paradigm vs implementation vs domain)
- Real-time canonification pattern (insights captured during execution)
- Producer/consumer legislative process (maturity measurement)
- Constitutional compliance through git signal (violations visible, recoverable)
- Triad requirement (CANON, VOCAB, README - all LLM-generated)
- VOCAB is temporal (evolves with machine, not static dictionary)
- Self-* properties (self-validating, self-documenting, self-healing, self-measuring, self-optimizing, self-strengthening)
- Every session is an episode (meta-circular writing)
- Episodes captured in real-time (fleeting moments, episodic memory)
- Episodes are ungoverned input (may be messy, contradictory, incomplete)
- GitHub is the ledger (single source of truth, consumed to compute local metrics)
- One episode spans many commits (producer + consumer sequences)

## Traceability

Every artifact reference must resolve:
- Repository links → must exist on GitHub
- Commit hashes → must exist in git history
- File paths → must exist at specified commits
- Git commands → must produce stated results
- Metrics → must be computable from git log

No broken links. No hallucinated references. Complete verifiability.

---

## Meta-Circular Properties

This paper:
- Documents the WRITING machine
- Is written using the WRITING machine
- Captures episodes from its own writing sessions
- Canonifies insights discovered during writing
- Validates its own claims against git history
- Demonstrates every pattern it describes

The system observes itself and reports findings.
