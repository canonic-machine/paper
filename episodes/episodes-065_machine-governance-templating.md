## The Session
We moved from template cleanup to governing the machine scope itself.

## Session narrative
After stripping templates to placeholders and adding a TEMPLATE spec, the machine scope still lacked its triad. The user asked to govern the machine and document templating. I restored the machine README and VOCAB, aligned MACHINE to CANON-closed vocabulary and README usage, and linked template conformance to the TEMPLATE spec in the machine rules. The result was a governed machine scope with templating explicitly referenced where enforcement happens.

## Resolution
- Regenerated machine README and VOCAB to satisfy the triad.
- Updated MACHINE to validate CANON-closed VOCAB and TEMPLATE conformance.
