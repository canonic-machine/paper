## The Session
We were asked to fix every episode canon violation by documenting it with a new episode.

## Session narrative
When we looked back at Episode 061, it contained a full SWAT section and a Resolution block. The user had already reminded us that episodes must be unprocessed and narrative-only, so we named this as a violation and recorded it here. The moment felt like cleanup after drift—quiet, corrective, and intentionally within the canon.
