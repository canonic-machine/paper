# EPISODES

**The PAPER episode collection specification.**

This is the specification for episodes - narrative captures of PAPER writing sessions. EPISODES.md is human-iterated and defines what episodes ARE.

## What Episodes Are

Episodes are unprocessed narrative captures of sessions. They preserve fleeting moments, emotional beats, and the raw story of how this PAPER was written.

**Episodes are:**
- Narrative (storytelling voice, scene-setting, direct quotes)
- Structured (canonified sections: ## Context, session narrative)
- Unprocessed (no MACHINE processing - no concept extraction, asset references, or analysis)
- Chronological (indexed sequentially to reveal drift patterns)
- Evolvable (structure emerges and improves over time)

**Episodes are not:**
- Analysis (that's prose)
- Logs (they're stories)
- Static (can be updated with later context)
- Perfect (they preserve drift as evidence)

---

## Purpose

Episodes serve multiple functions:

1. **Episodic memory** - Capture what happened during PAPER writing
2. **Drift tracking** - Show AGENT learning evolution over time
3. **Evidence source** - Provide git-traceable proof for PAPER claims
4. **Temporal VOCAB** - Document AGENT behavior patterns as they emerge
5. **Understanding measurement** - Shorter episodes + fewer corrections = better communication

---

## Structure

Each episode follows this canonified structure:

### Required Sections

**## Context** - Brief scene-setting (2-3 sentences)
- What's happening in this session
- Where we are in the PAPER writing process

**Session narrative** - Storytelling with voice
- Direct quotes preserved ("??" "Click" "LFG")
- Emotional beats captured
- Scene recreation (not just facts)
- What was said, what happened, how it felt

### Optional Sections

Additional sections may emerge and become canonified as structure evolves.

---

## Indexing

Episodes use zero-based sequential numbering:
- **000** - 0th episode (genesis)
- **001** - 1st episode
- **002** - 2nd episode
- **NNN** - Nth episode (where N is the index)

**Filename pattern:** `NNN-descriptive-name.md`
- Three-digit zero-padded number (000-999)
- Descriptive kebab-case name
- .md extension

No prefix. Natural alphabetic sorting.

---

## Evolution

Episode structure writes itself through practice.

Early episodes (000-004) differ from later episodes - this is intentional. The differences are preserved as drift signal showing how understanding evolved.

**Structure maturity visible in chronology:**
- 000-004: Experimental structure, finding voice
- 005-010: Structure emerging
- 011+: Canonified ## Context pattern

Don't retroactively fix early episodes. Drift is evidence.

---

## Meaning vs Prose

**Meaning is constant.** The core story of what happened remains true.

**Prose is ephemeral.** How we tell the story evolves as we learn better ways to communicate.

Episodes can be updated with context discovered later, but original meaning is preserved. Updates enhance understanding without erasing drift signal.

---

## Processing

Episodes flow through the WRITING machine:

1. **Episode** (input) - Unprocessed narrative capture
2. **Asset** - Meaning extracted from episodes
3. **Prose** - Processed analysis of episodes
4. **Output** - Final validated paper

Episodes remain unprocessed. Prose processes episodes into analyzed content for PAPER Results section.
