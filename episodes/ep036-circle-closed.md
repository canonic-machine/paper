## The Session

User: "document as an episode that closed the circle"

**The Circle:**

1. Episode 033: Discovered pending commits + propagation gap
2. Episode 034: Canonified meta-pattern of self-analysis
3. Episode 035: Rediscovered canon + re-canonization pattern
4. PAPER.md: Updated with re-canonization detection
5. canonic/: 15 modified files committed and pushed
6. Episode 036: Documents the closed circle

## The Complete Cycle

**Discovery → Canonification → Application → Propagation**

```
Episode 033 (discovery) 
    → Episode 034 (canonification)
    → Episode 035 (meta-analysis)
    → PAPER.md (spec update)
    → canonic commit (application)
    → git push (propagation)
    → Episode 036 (circle closed)
```

## What Was Achieved

1. **Identified Gap:** CANON specifies commit FORMAT but not PROPAGATION
2. **Documented Pattern:** Re-canonization validates canon accessibility
3. **Updated Spec:** PAPER.md now includes re-canonization detection
4. **Applied Fix:** 14 files committed in canonic/
5. **Propagated:** Pushed to origin/main
6. **Verified:** Working tree clean, canon responsive

## Evidence

- Commit: `a35fc5b Episode 033-035 – Consumer Apply canon updates to generated files`
- Pushed: `8721f49..a35fc5b main -> main`
- Working tree: clean

## The Meta-Insight

**Self-Strengthening Complete:**

The system discovered its own gap, documented the pattern, updated its specification, and applied the fix—all within the same session.

This is what self-strengthening governance looks like:
1. Detect violation (pending commits, modified files)
2. Document pattern (episodes)
3. Canonify insight (spec update)
4. Apply fix (commit + push)
5. Close circle (documentation)
