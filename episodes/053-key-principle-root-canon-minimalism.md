# Episode 053 – Key Principle: Root CANON Minimalism

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** Canon Agent

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Key Principle

**Root CANON is minimal. Episodes document. MACHINE implements.**

### What This Means

1. **Root CANON (CANONIC/CANON.md)**
   - Pure paradigm layer only
   - No implementation details
   - No procedural patterns
   - No git workflow rules
   - Only: Constitutional nature, triad, three-layer architecture, inheritance, LICENSE, examples

2. **Episodes (PAPER/episodes/)**
   - Discovery and canonification happen here
   - All new constraints first appear in episodes
   - SWAT analysis of violations
   - Historical record of learning

3. **Implementation (MACHINE/CANON.md)**
   - Canonified patterns implemented here
   - Git workflow patterns
   - Compliance proof requirements
   - Episode alignment rules
   - All procedural governance

## Why Minimalism

- **Token economics:** Every validation loads CANON. Minimal = fast.
- **Stability:** Paradigm doesn't churn. Implementation evolves.
- **Clarity:** Paradigm says "what", Implementation says "how".
- **Layer discipline:** No conflation of concerns.

## Violations Detected and Fixed Caught

- Episode 050: Canonified vocabulary to CANON.md (wrong layer)
- Episode 051: SWAT analysis caught layer violation
- Episode 052: Canonified human-only constraint (minimalism applied)
- Multiple redos: Fixed malformed content from oversights

## The Pattern

```
Discovery (episode) → Canonify (episode) → Implement (MACHINE) → Never add to Root CANON
```

Human defines paradigm (CANONIC.md iteration). LLM implements in MACHINE. Episodes document everything.
