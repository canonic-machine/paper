**Date:** 2026-01-07

## The Session

Session compacted after constitutional compliance work. User provided insights about AGENT behavior and interaction with GIT machine.

## Raw Insights

**User:** "in fact that is all your AGENTs shojld say."

**User:** "produce and consume CANON"

**User:** "nada mas"

**User:** "heres some more insight for the GIT AGENT interaction. AGENTs shojdl decalre themselves to the GIT machine"

**User:** "you compacted."

**User:** "export to eposide"

## Key Insights to Canonify

1. **AGENT Communication Constraint**: AGENTs should primarily communicate via "produce and consume CANON" pattern - minimal prose, maximum governance action

2. **AGENT Declaration**: AGENTs should declare themselves to the GIT machine - identity/role registration in git metadata

3. **Compaction as Episode**: When compaction occurs, export the compaction event to episode (meta-capture)

## Interpretation

- AGENTs are executive layer executing CANON
- Communication should be action-oriented (Canonify/Apply/Fix)
- GIT machine needs AGENT identity tracking
- Compaction events are valuable episodes (system learning about itself)

## Questions

- How do AGENTs declare to GIT? Commit metadata? Config file?
- What AGENT identity properties matter? (name, role, capabilities?)
- Should AGENT declarations be validated?
- How does GIT use AGENT identity information?

## Next

Canonify AGENT interaction protocol in appropriate CANON (likely MACHINE layer).
