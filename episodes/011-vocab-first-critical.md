## The Session

User: "ok. theres some meta insight to canonify"
User: "VOCAB first]"
User: "its critical"

## The Insight

VOCAB must come FIRST when building or understanding CANONIC systems.

Not CANON first. Not README first. VOCAB first.

## Why Critical

Without vocabulary definitions, CANON constraints are ambiguous. Terms like "triad", "producer", "episode", "asset" - what do they mean?

Reading CANON before VOCAB = interpreting constraints with undefined terms = drift.

## Implication

VOCAB is the foundation. It defines the language. CANON uses that language to state constraints.

**Order of comprehension:**
1. VOCAB (learn the language)
2. CANON (understand the constraints in that language)
3. README (see how to use it)

**Order of creation might differ** (spec first, then VOCAB extracted), but **order of reading/understanding** must be VOCAB first.

## User Signal

"VOCAB first]" with bracket suggests this is critical/canonical notation.

User emphasizing: "its critical"

This is foundational insight about CANONIC comprehension order.
