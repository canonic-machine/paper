**Episode:** 068  
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Context:** Violation response requirement and episode 067  
**Agent:** codex

## Context
We were reviewing why some episodes include SWAT sections and others do not, and the user asked to document the violation and then canonify SWAT after any violation.

## Session narrative
The answer landed plainly: SWAT was practice, not canon, which is why Episode 067 existed without a formal SWAT requirement. The user asked to document that gap and then canonify SWAT analysis after any violation. The moment clarified the rule path—capture the violation in an episode, and move the SWAT requirement into canon so it becomes enforceable going forward.
