## The Session

User: "its fine. hers a meta insight to canonify in the paper. episodes should help us to track drift in your understanding. whats special about episodes vs prose??"

## The Question

Why keep episodes with AI violations (like ep002 "Key Insights" sections) instead of fixing them?

## The Answer

**Episodes track AGENT drift over time.**

## Episodes vs Prose

**Episodes:**
- Temporal snapshots (timestamped, sequential, immutable)
- Show AGENT evolution chronologically
- Preserve learning curve and mistakes
- ep001-004: AI imposing structure (before constraint)
- ep005-010: AI learning minimal structure (after learning)
- The drift itself becomes data

**Prose:**
- Refined, regenerated, corrected
- Reflects current understanding only
- Loses historical drift signal
- Gets updated when constraints change

## The Meta Insight

Episodes are temporal VOCAB for AGENT behavior.

Just like VOCAB shows how terminology evolved (VOCABULARY → DICTIONARY → VOCAB), episodes show how AGENT understanding evolved.

**Don't fix episode violations** - they're evidence of learning.

Drift signal preserved = system measuring itself = self-measuring property in action.

## Paper Implication

Episodes with violations aren't bugs - they're features. They prove:
1. AGENT learns through canonification
2. System measures its own evolution
3. Git + episodes = complete learning history
4. Drift detection works (human caught violations, AGENT adapted)

The drift in episodes validates the governance model.
