## The Session
We clarified the inheritance chain to place TUNING between MACHINE and PAPER. The goal was to document separation of concerns and the new scope boundary.

## Session narrative
You stated it plainly: paper now inherits from tuning, and tuning inherits from machine. That instantly resolved the placement of violation governance. I updated the chain and noted that this is about separation of concerns—paradigm, machine, tuning, writing, paper—each responsible for a distinct function. The stack felt more disciplined once that boundary was named.
