# Episode 063: Template Nomenclature Reset

**Episode:** 063  
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Context:** Template generalization and SPEC naming  
**Agent:** codex

## Context
We were tightening templates to avoid CANONIC-specific language and clarifying that SPEC is the variable while CANONIC is the value.

## Session narrative
The user stopped the flow: the templates were mixing documentation with canon, and the CANONIC file title was misnamed as "SPEC". The correction was simple but structural: templates must be general, and CANONIC should stand as the value, not the type. That reframed the work back to reproducible structure without canon bloat.

---

## Resolution
- Generalized SPEC, README, CANON, and VOCAB templates to be neutral and placeholder-driven.
- Renamed the CANONIC spec header to `# CANONIC`.
