## The Session
We created a separate SWAT.md file in the PAPER repo, and the user immediately flagged it as a canon violation because only episodes should carry the prose record.

## Session narrative
The correction was direct: that SWAT file was another violation. The user asked for a redo and for SWAT analysis to live in episodes. I removed the file and documented the violation here, keeping the response inside the episode canon.
