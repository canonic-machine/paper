# Episode 062: SPEC as Reproducible Generation

**Episode:** 062  
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Context:** CANONIC regeneration method and triad linkage  
**Agent:** codex

## Context
We were refining CANONIC so it stays minimal, reproducible, and aligned with the CANON -> VOCAB -> README chain.

## Session narrative
The insight landed: SPEC should define how CANON and VOCAB are generated, not just what they are. We named the closure: a CANON-closed vocabulary that only spans CANON (not SPEC), with README following VOCAB. The point was clarity and reproducibility: SPEC describes the method, MACHINE implements it, and the triad stays coherent by construction.
