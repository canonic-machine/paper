# Episode 080: Episode Standard Redo

**Date:** January 9, 2026
**Type:** Redo
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

---

## The Session

We redid the episode canon to restore the standardized format (Episode 000 structure) without editing historical episodes. The goal was to correct drift through forward-only governance.

## Key Assets Discovered

- Standardized episode structure enables repeatable consumption
- Redo commits correct false canon without rewriting history

## Violations Detected and Fixed

**Fix:** Canon updated to require Episode 000 structure and SWAT in the violations section, with immutability preserved.

## Git Signal

- Redo canon commit recorded in CANON.md and EPISODES.md.

## The Insight

Episode drift is corrected by canon changes and new episodes, not by rewriting history. The archive remains immutable while the standard evolves forward.

**Status:** Redo complete; standard enforced forward-only.
