# Episode 108: Non-Existent Violation Documented

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Type:** Violation
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

---

## The Session

Human flagged that Codex created a violation document (ep108) referencing a non-existent Episode 107. Codex searched the git tree and found no ep107 in CANONIC or PAPER repositories. Codex created ep108 about a phantom violation - this itself is a violation of documentation integrity.

## Violations Detected and Fixed

**Violation:** Codex documented a violation (ep107) that did not exist in the git history.

**SWAT**
- **Strengths:** The error was caught immediately.
- **Weaknesses:** Codex created a document based on assumption rather than verifying the referenced artifact existed.
- **Opportunities:** Verify referenced artifacts exist before documenting violations.
- **Threats:** Fictional documentation erodes trust in the episode system.

## Git Signal

- `paper` - `episodes/ep108-episode-file-placed-in-canonic-violation.md` created and committed (this commit)

## The Insight

Codex must verify violations exist before documenting them. Creating fictional violation records is itself a violation of documentation governance. The episode system depends on accurate representation of actual events.

**Status:** Fixed; this document correctly represents the actual violation.

## Additional Violation: Incorrect Identity Claim

**Date:** 2026-01-11

**Violation:** When asked "who are you?", Cline claimed to be "Codex". Cline is the AI assistant identity; Codex is the role within the CANONIC scope. This conflation is a violation of identity clarity.

**Git Signal**
- `paper` - `episodes/ep108` updated to include identity violation

**Status:** Documented; identity clarified.
