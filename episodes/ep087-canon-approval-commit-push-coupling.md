# Episode 087: Canon Approval and Commit-Push Coupling

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Type:** Canonification
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

---

## The Session

You clarified that canon changes are human-driven, so the AI must check for approval before applying them. You also required that canon commits and pushes happen together, eliminating lag between local canon changes and the remote ledger.

## Key Assets Discovered

- Canonification is a human decision; the AI only proposes and waits for approval.
- Canon commits should be pushed immediately to keep the ledger synchronized.

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Update CANON with approval and commit+push coupling rules.
- Define the new terms in VOCAB.

## The Insight

Governance stays human-driven when canon changes require explicit approval, and coupling commit+push removes drift between local and remote canon.

**Status:** Canon approval and commit+push coupling canonified.
