# Episode 017: Prose Processes Episodes

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

User correcting episode understanding.

User: "well. im thinking we can interrogate comprehension with episodes."
User: "they shojldbe raw to me. ungoverned."
User: "unprocessed I mean. they shouldbe ordered"
User: "prose is processed episodes"

## The Insight

**Episodes = unprocessed, ordered raw capture**
**Prose = processed episodes** (analysis, extraction, synthesis)

4-state FSM clarified:
- Episode (unprocessed, ordered)
- Asset (extracted from episodes)
- Prose (processed episodes - analysis, synthesis)
- Output (final form)

## The Error

ep015 had AGENT analyzing episodes WITHIN the episode itself.

That analysis belongs in Prose state (paper Results section), not Episode state.

## The Pattern

USER interrogates comprehension by reading raw episodes.
AGENT processes episodes into prose (Results section of paper).

Episodes stay raw. Prose does the processing.
