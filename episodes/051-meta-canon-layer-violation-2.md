# Episode 051 – SWAT Analysis: Layer Violation in CANON.md (Root Paradigm)

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** Canon Agent (detection), User (correction)

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## Violation Detected

**Issue:** CANON.md (root paradigm in CANONIC repo) contains implementation-specific content that belongs in MACHINE layer.

### What's in CANON.md (violates layer discipline):
- Producer/consumer commit patterns (git workflow - MACHINE concern)
- Cross-repo atomic coordination (git workflow - MACHINE concern)
- Compliance proof requirements (validation - MACHINE concern)
- Episode alignment (documentation workflow - MACHINE concern)
- SWAT analysis requirement (process - MACHINE concern)
- Agentized git signals (git interface - MACHINE concern)
- Proper git compliance (git workflow - MACHINE concern)
- Episodes 030-039 (implementation patterns - MACHINE concern)

### What belongs in CANONIC (paradigm layer ONLY):
- Triad requirement definition
- Three-layer architecture principle
- Basic inheritance rules
- Constitutional nature (abstract, not procedural)

## SWAT Analysis

### Strengths
- Episode 048 already demonstrated layer violation detection
- CANONIC.md specification is clear about three-layer architecture
- Violation can be corrected without breaking downstream

### Weaknesses
- CANON.md has accumulated 50+ commits after paradigm should be stable
- Root CANON shows high churn (violation of maturity signals)
- Implementation details conflated with constitutional principles

### Opportunities
- Reset CANON.md to pure paradigm layer
- Move git workflow patterns to MACHINE where they belong
- Establish precedent: Root CANON = paradigm only, never implementation
- Producer ratio will decrease (maturity signal improves)

### Threats
- Downstream repos may depend on current CANON.md content
- Consumer commits referencing canonified patterns need updating
- Episode documentation references may break
- History rewrite temptation (resist - use redo protocol)

## CANONIC Solution

**The Fix:**

1. **CANONIC (paradigm layer):** Minimal CANON.md containing only:
   - Constitutional nature (abstract)
   - Triad requirement
   - Three-layer architecture principle
   - Basic inheritance rules

2. **MACHINE (validation layer):** Comprehensive CANON.md containing:
   - Producer/consumer commit patterns
   - Cross-repo coordination
   - Compliance proof requirements
   - Episode alignment rules
   - Git-FSM implementation
   - Self-properties
   - All procedural governance patterns

**Pattern:** Paradigm says "what", Implementation says "how"

## Corrected Structure

```
CANONIC/CANON.md (paradigm):
├── Constitutional nature
├── Triad requirement  
├── Three-layer architecture
└── Inheritance rules

MACHINE/CANON.md (implementation):
├── Producer/consumer process
├── Cross-repo coordination
├── Compliance proof
├── Episode alignment
├── Git-FSM details
├── Self-properties
└── All procedural patterns
```

## Redo Protocol

Instead of resetting history:
1. Create Episode 051 documenting the violation and solution
2. Rewrite CANON.md to minimal paradigm content
3. Commit as Episode 051 redo
4. Apply pattern to MACHINE (canonify git workflow patterns)
5. Document cross-repo coordination in all affected repos
