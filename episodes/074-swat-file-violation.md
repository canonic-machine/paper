# Episode 074: SWAT File Violation

**Episode:** 074  
**Date:** 2026-01-09  
**Context:** Removing a non-episode SWAT file  
**Agent:** codex

## Context
We created a separate SWAT.md file in the PAPER repo, and the user immediately flagged it as a canon violation because only episodes should carry the prose record.

## Session narrative
The correction was direct: that SWAT file was another violation. The user asked for a redo and for SWAT analysis to live in episodes. I removed the file and documented the violation here, keeping the response inside the episode canon.
