## The Discovery

The VOCAB itself must be fully governed.

This is a meta-insight: VOCAB is not just a governance artifact—it must demonstrate governance properties. The vocabulary that defines coherent, compliant, and fully governed must itself be coherent, compliant, and fully governed.

---

## The Insight

VOCAB self-governance requires:

1. **Coherent constraints**: All term definitions must be logically consistent, non-contradictory, and form a coherent system of meaning
2. **Compliant structure**: Must maintain alphabetical ordering, proper section headers, and complete triad relationships
3. **Fully governed state**: The combination of coherent definitions within compliant structure

This creates a **recursive property**:
- VOCAB defines fully governed
- VOCAB must be fully governed
- Consumers of VOCAB learn what fully governed means by examining VOCAB itself

## VOCAB Self-Governance Requirements

### Coherence requirements
- Term definitions do not contradict each other
- Cross-references are accurate and consistent
- Categories (Core Paradigm, Governance, Validation, etc.) are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
- No orphaned or empty section headers

### Compliance requirements
- Alphabetical ordering within each section (case-insensitive)
- Proper header hierarchy (## for sections, ### for terms)
- Consistent formatting (bold for key terms, backticks for code)
- All required triad files present (CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md)

### Fully governed state
VOCAB achieves fully governed when:
- Syntactic validation passes (structure correct)
- Semantic validation passes (definitions coherent)
- The vocabulary is complete and self-referential

---

## The Canonification

**Action taken:** Canonified VOCAB self-governance as a principle in root CANON.md

**Key constraint added:**

```
### VOCAB self-governance
**The VOCAB itself must be fully governed.**

VOCAB is not just a governance artifact—it must demonstrate governance properties.
The vocabulary that defines coherent, compliant, and fully governed must itself
be coherent, compliant, and fully governed.

**Requirements:**
- All term definitions must be logically consistent (coherent)
- Structure must maintain alphabetical ordering and proper headers (compliant)
- Cross-references must be accurate and complete (coherent + compliant)

**Violation:** VOCAB contains contradictions, ordering violations, or broken references.
```

---

## The Proof

1. **Meta-insight**: VOCAB self-governance is recursive
2. **Discovery**: Canonbase review revealed the need for self-referential governance
3. **Canonification**: Added VOCAB self-governance constraint to root CANON
4. **Consumption**: All downstream VOCABs must inherit this property

This insight completes the governance loop—VOCAB doesn't just define governance, it embodies it.
