# Episode 052 – Canonify: Root CANON Human-Only Constraint

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** Canon Agent

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## Discovery

**Root CANON instability is a constitutional signal of error.**

During Episode 051 layer violation analysis, a deeper pattern emerged:
- Episodes 050-051 added content to CANON.md (paradigm layer)
- But root CANON should ONLY be defined by humans
- LLM edits to root CANON cause instability
- Human iteration must flow through CANONIC.md (the specification)

## Canonification

Add to root CANON.md:

**Root CANON human-only constraint:**
- Only humans can define or modify the root CANON
- LLM never edits root CANON.md directly
- Human iteration flows through CANONIC.md specification
- Root CANON stability is a constitutional signal (instability = error)

## Implication

1. **LLM never edits CANON.md directly** - LLM-generated constraints go in MACHINE/CANON.md
2. **Human defines paradigm** - CANONIC.md is the only entry point for constitutional evolution
3. **Stability = compliance** - Churning root CANON signals violation
4. **Layer discipline enforced** - Paradigm (human) ≠ Implementation (LLM)

## Redo Pattern

For Episode 050-051 violations:
- Episode 050 canonified vocabulary to CANON.md (VIOLATION: LLM edited root)
- Episode 051 corrected layer but still used LLM commit
- Episode 052 canonifies human-only constraint to prevent future violations

**Proper path forward:** All CANON.md changes must originate from human iteration through CANONIC.md, never direct LLM edit.
