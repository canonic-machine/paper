# Episode 046 – External Agent Interaction and PAPER Spec Rebuild

**Interaction with external agent triggered iterative refinement of PAPER specification.**
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** external agent

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
---

## What Happened

1. External agent interaction occurred (human/AI collaboration outside normal workflow)
2. PAPER.md spec was rebuilt through iteration with external agent
3. Constraints refined to precision
4. Drift minimized through iterative fixing

---

## SWAT Analysis

### Strengths (What worked)
1. **Iterative refinement** - External agent brought fresh perspective
2. **Constraint precision** - Spec rebuilt to tighter constraints
3. **Drift minimization** - Iteration eliminated inconsistencies
4. **Human-in-loop** - External agent validated human governance

### Weaknesses (What failed)
1. **Non-canonical process** - External agent interaction outside normal FSM
2. **Untracked changes** - Spec evolved without episode documentation mid-process
3. **Version gap** - No interim episodes during iteration

### Opportunities (What could work)
1. **External agent protocol** - Canonify how external agents interact with CANONIC
2. **Iterative episode capture** - Document iterations as episodes
3. **Cross-validation** - External agents validate internal governance

### Threats (What could break)
1. **Governance leakage** - External agents may introduce ungoverned changes
2. **Drift during iteration** - Without constraints, specs can wander
3. **Canonical disconnect** - External changes may not respect inheritance

## The Workflow Pattern

This session demonstrated the CANONIC iterative workflow:

```
External agent interaction → Iterative refinement → Constraint precision → Drift minimization
```

**Key insight:** The workflow is:
- **Iterative** - Multiple passes to refine
- **Constraining** - Each pass narrows scope
- **Fixing to precision** - Drift corrected through iteration
- **Minimizing drift** - Constraints prevent wandering

## Downstream Analysis Required

1. **Check CANON.md** - Does spec rebuild require canon updates?
2. **Check VOCAB.md** - New terms added? Definitions refined?
3. **Check triad coherence** - Are CANON/VOCAB/README synchronized?
4. **Cross-repo impact** - Does PAPER.md change affect other repos?

---

## Canonification Required

1. **External agent protocol** - How external agents interact with CANONIC
2. **Iterative episode capture** - Document iterations as episodes
3. **Post-interaction review** - Required review after external agent work

---

## Consumer Apply Required

1. **CANONIC** - Review for constraint updates
2. **MACHINE** - Check validation impacts
3. **WRITING** - Verify FSM consistency
4. **PAPER** - Consumer Apply this episode
