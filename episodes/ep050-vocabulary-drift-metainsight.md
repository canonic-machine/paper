**Participants:** Unknown
## The Discovery (Historical)

During compliance review of all machines, a vocabulary drift was detected:

**Two distinct compliance concepts conflated:**

1. **CANONIC compliance** - Compliance with the root constitution/paradigm (governance layer)
2. **CANON compliance** - Compliance with the execution of a specific CANON (implementation layer)

## Episode 051 Resolution

Episode 051 corrected the layer violation:
- Episode 050 canonified vocabulary to CANON.md (VIOLATION: wrong layer)
- Episode 051 reset CANON.md to pure paradigm layer
- Vocabulary patterns moved to MACHINE where they belong
