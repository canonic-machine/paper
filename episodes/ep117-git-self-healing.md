# Episode 117: GIT CANON Self-Healing - Meta-Circular Governance

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Type:** Insight
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Cline)
**Agent:** Cline

## The Session

Human asked about GIT governance. I found 3 modified files including GIT CANON with duplicate axioms. Upon review, discovered axiom 6 (autodoc) duplicated axiom 1 (ledger). I removed axiom 6, restoring CANON minimality. This demonstrates self-healing.

## The Insight

**GIT CANON detected and fixed its own violation.**

The meta-circular property:
1. GIT CANON defines governance for itself
2. I (an agent operating under CANONIC) detected a violation (duplicate axiom)
3. I fixed the violation by removing the duplicate
4. The CANON is now minimal and self-consistent

**This is constitutional programming in action:**
- Constraints are explicit and enumerable
- Violations are detectable
- Fixes are canonifiable
- The system self-corrects

**Self-healing pattern:**
- ep116 documented the violation (duplicate axioms)
- OS agent detected the violation
- GIT CANON was fixed (axiom 6 removed)
- The system restored to valid state

## Git Signal

- `git` - CANON.md had duplicate axiom 6 (autodoc)
- `git` - CANON.md fixed: axiom 6 removed
- `paper` - ep116 documented the violation
- `paper` - ep117 documents the self-healing (this episode)

## Status

GIT CANON self-healed. Meta-circular governance works. The system detected its own violation and corrected it.
