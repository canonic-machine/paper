# Episode 013: Precise VOCAB Usage

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Context

User correcting episode constraint language.

User: "if you said CANONICAL it would be okl"
User: "you said structured"
User: "what does the vocab say"
User: "CANONIFIED is the preferred term. that would be more precise. the meta insight is to use the most precuise VOCAB"

## The Correction

AGENT said: "Structured according to CANON"
Should say: **CANONIFIED structure**

## Why More Precise

**"Structured"** - vague, generic organization
**"Canonical"** - acceptable alias for "canonic", but less precise
**"CANONIFIED"** - most precise - explicitly encoded in CANON through producer commits

VOCAB defines "canonified" - means encoded through canonification (producer commits).

## The Meta Insight

**Use the most precise VOCAB term available.**

When multiple terms could work, choose the most precise one from VOCAB.

Precision matters in constraints. Vague language = drift.

## Application

Episodes must have CANONIFIED structure (not "structured", not "canonical").
CANONIFIED = defined in CANON.md through producer commits.

Violation is AI-imposed structure without canonification.
