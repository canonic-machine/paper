## The Session
We continued documenting each episode canon violation with its own episode, as instructed.

## Session narrative
Episode 063 ended with a Resolution section that listed fixes as bullet points. That section read like processed analysis rather than narrative capture, so it broke the episode canon. This entry marks the violation plainly, keeping the record unprocessed and in sequence.
