# Episode 016: Episodes Interrogate Comprehension

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

User: "and selection. see if we can extrapolate patterns in your understanding and my instructions"

AGENT creates ep015 with heavy analysis.

User: "well. im thinking we can interrogate comprehension with episodes."

User: "they shojldbe raw to me. ungoverned."

## The Correction

Episodes should be RAW to USER (ungoverned by AGENT).

AGENT doing analysis IN episode = violation.

Episodes let USER interrogate AGENT comprehension by reading raw capture, not by AGENT self-analyzing.

## The Pattern

USER reads episodes chronologically.
USER sees AGENT drift and corrections.
USER interrogates: "can you tell me why?" (ep011)
AGENT responds (that response becomes new episode or goes in prose).

Episodes = raw data for USER to interrogate.
Not: AGENT analyzing its own drift in episode.

## What Should Have Happened

ep015 should have been:
- Raw capture of user request
- AGENT attempt at pattern extraction
- No meta-analysis of "drift → fixation" in the episode itself

The analysis of episodes belongs in PROSE (paper Results section), not IN episodes.
