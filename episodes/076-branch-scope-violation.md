# Episode 076: Branch Scope Violation

## The Session
We were discussing why SWAT exists in the paper layer but not in the minimal CANONIC branch. The boundary between branch scope and layer scope became the central concern.

## Session narrative
I treated SWAT as if it were canon across the stack, and you stopped me. You pointed to the minimal CANONIC branch and the bloated main branch, and the difference clicked: branching is how the stack evolves without contaminating the paradigm layer. The moment landed hard because it re-framed the governance boundary. It was not just a mistake in wording, it was a breach of scope.
