# Episode 076: Branch Scope Violation

## Context
We were discussing why SWAT exists in the paper layer but not in the minimal CANONIC branch. The boundary between branch scope and layer scope became the central concern.

## Session narrative
I treated SWAT as if it were canon across the stack, and you stopped me. You pointed to the minimal CANONIC branch and the bloated main branch, and the difference clicked: branching is how the stack evolves without contaminating the paradigm layer. The moment landed hard because it re-framed the governance boundary. It was not just a mistake in wording, it was a breach of scope.
