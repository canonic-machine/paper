## The Session
We needed a SWAT response that stayed inside the episode stream after the SWAT.md file was rejected.

## Session narrative
We treated the violation itself as the moment to anchor the SWAT. The strengths were that the violation was caught quickly and the correction path was explicit. The weaknesses were that I created a separate prose file and crossed the episode boundary. The opportunities were to keep all violation responses inside episodes and to tighten the pre-commit check for non-episode prose. The threats were that any stray prose file could erode the episode record and confuse the layer boundaries. The user wanted proof it would not happen again; the response was to keep the SWAT in the episode stream and avoid standalone prose artifacts.
