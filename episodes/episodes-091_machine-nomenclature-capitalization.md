# Episode 091: Machine Nomenclature Capitalization

**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Type:** Canonification
**Participants:** USER, AI
**Agent:** Codex

## The Session

Refactored MACHINE nomenclature so only CANON, TRIAD, and SPEC are uppercase identifiers. Updated the machine canon and vocab to match this rule.

## Key Assets Discovered

- machine/CANON.md
- machine/VOCAB.md

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- MACHINE commit `c002754` (Refine nomenclature capitalization)

## The Insight

Uppercase naming should be reserved for the governing identifiers CANON, TRIAD, and SPEC; other artifact labels remain lowercase in prose while series naming remains SPEC-based.

**Status:** Recorded
