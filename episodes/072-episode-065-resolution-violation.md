## Context
We were finalizing the list of recent episode violations and documenting each one in sequence.

## Session narrative
Episode 065 closed with a Resolution section that summarized actions, which crossed into analysis instead of narrative capture. This episode records that violation and keeps the fix within the episode canon: context and story only.
