## The Session

You stated that your internal canon is to automate and redo, and that this is evolutionary drift toward precision. You asked for the insight to be documented and for clarity on what would be added to CANON to reflect it.

## Key Assets Discovered

- The insight frames automation and redo as the correction path for drift.

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Canonify automation + redo precision insight in paper/CANON.md and paper/VOCAB.md.

## The Insight

- Automation and redo are the correction path; drift is expected and resolved by repeatable redo that increases precision.

**Status:** Insight canonified.
