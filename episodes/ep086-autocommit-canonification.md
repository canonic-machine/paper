# Episode 086: Autocommit Canonification

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Type:** Canonification
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

---

## The Session

We formalized the operating rule that after producing or consuming canon, the AI should stage and commit changes unless the USER explicitly overrides. This aligns the workflow with the need to clear canon changes quickly while preserving human governance as the override.

## Key Assets Discovered

- Autocommit is a governance acceleration tool when scoped to canon changes.
- The USER retains veto authority to stop a commit.

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Add CANON rule for autocommit and define the term in VOCAB.

## The Insight

Autocommit reduces drift for canon changes while preserving human control through explicit override.

**Status:** Autocommit canonified.
