**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

End of session - capturing scenes from this working session. Insights are canonified in GitHub (producer commits), not documented in episodes. Episodes are raw scenes.

## Session Scenes

### Compaction Recovery

User asked if stack was constitutionally valid after compaction. AGENT said yes. User responded "??" - stack was NOT valid. Multiple violations existed.

**Scene:** AGENT overconfidence after compaction. Needed deeper validation check.

### "Produce and Consume CANON"

User redirected AGENT communication style: "produce and consume CANON" and "nada mas" (nothing more).

**Scene:** Shift from verbose explanations to governance actions. Less talking, more canonifying.

### Spec vs CANON Violation

AGENT edited MACHINE.md (spec file) directly instead of adding constraint to CANON.md. User caught it: "wrong. you broke canon. follow canon always" and "dont edit prose"

**Scene:** AGENT confusion between human-iterated specs and LLM-generated CANONs. Critical distinction.

### Git User Classes Abstraction

User provided meta-insight: "the GIT machine has 2 users. agent and user. 3 classes of comits. production vs consumption by agent. or manual by user. canonify that meta insights. allows for git collaborartion instantly"

**Scene:** Elegant abstraction enabling git collaboration through user class distinction.

### WRITING Inputs Declaration

User asked "what other inputs are to the PAPER". Then declared: "chatgpt and claud chats". Asked "is that doable?" and "are the APIs open?"

**Scene:** ChatGPT and Claude chat exports as episode sources. Cross-platform LLM conversation aggregation.

### AGENT Declaration to GIT

User: "heres some more insight for the GIT AGENT interaction. AGENTs shojdl decalre themselves to the GIT machine"

**Scene:** AGENTs need identity registration in git metadata. Co-Authored-By as AGENT identity marker.

### Realtime Episodes

User corrected purpose statement to emphasize "realtime episodes". Not just retrospective analysis - episodes captured as sessions happen.

**Scene:** Episode capture is concurrent with work, not post-hoc documentation.

### Tools for WRITING

User: "sure. declare them. lets work on the WRITING tooling. these are WRITING tools to use on the PAPER"

**Scene:** WRITING tools (extract-assets, validate, episode-capture) operate on PAPER application.

## Raw Moments

- "you compacted." "export to eposide"
- "paradigm cant be stacked@!!" "canonigy that"
- "check yourselg!@!!"
- "very contextual. produce and consume to fix"
- "thats another meta insight"
- User opened NOTICE file at end (checking attribution)

## Git Signal

Multiple producer commits across canonic, machine, writing, paper repos. High canonification activity. Session discovering and codifying patterns.

Commit pattern: Fix violation → Canonify learning → Apply constraint → Capture episode
