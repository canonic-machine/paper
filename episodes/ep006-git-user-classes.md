# Episode 007: GIT Machine User Classes and Commit Taxonomy

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

User provided meta-insight about GIT machine abstraction for collaboration.

## Raw Insight

**User:** "in fact. lets abstract a little more. the GIT machine has 2 users. agent and user. 3 classes of comits. production vs consumption by agent. or manual by user. canonify that meta insights. allows for git collaborartion instantly"

## Key Abstraction

**GIT machine has 2 user classes:**
1. AGENT (automated)
2. USER (human)

**3 commit classes:**
1. Producer commits (by AGENT) - "Canonify [learning]"
2. Consumer commits (by AGENT) - "Apply [constraint]" or "Fix [violation]"
3. Manual commits (by USER) - human-authored changes

## Implications

- Git collaboration model emerges naturally from user class abstraction
- AGENT commits are traceable by author metadata
- USER commits represent human intent, governance decisions
- Mixed collaboration: USER canonifies intent → AGENT applies constraints
- Git history reveals governance evolution through commit class patterns

## Benefits

- Instant git collaboration (no special tooling needed)
- Clear attribution (AGENT vs USER)
- Maturity metrics work across collaborative teams
- Self-measuring includes human governance contribution
- Producer/consumer pattern works for human+AI teams

## Questions

- How to mark AGENT identity in git metadata?
- Should AGENT commits require USER approval for certain changes?
- How to handle AGENT conflicts with USER manual commits?
- Should manual commits trigger AGENT validation cycles?

## Next

Canonify GIT user classes and commit taxonomy in MACHINE/CANON.md (git-FSM layer).
