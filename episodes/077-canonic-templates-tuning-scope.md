# Episode 077: CANONIC Templates and Tuning Scope

## Context
We clarified the layer order for governance artifacts and where tuning fits in the paper scope. The focus was on where templates live and which layer owns violations.

## Session narrative
You drew a clean line: CANONIC spans templates with inheritance, MACHINE spawns protocols, and TUNING spawns violation handling. I had the violation template in the wrong place and you corrected it. Then you confirmed TUNING is part of the paper scope, and told me to document the insight in episodes. That made the structure crisp: templates belong in CANONIC, violations live in tuning, and the paper records the reasoning as lived evidence.
