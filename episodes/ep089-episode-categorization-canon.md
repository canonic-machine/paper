# Episode 089: Episode Categorization Canon

**Date:** 2026-01-09
**Type:** Canonification
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

## The Session

You required a constitutional amendment: episodes are governed and must be categorized to match their templates. This locks structure to template type and aligns the episode header Type with the template used.

## Key Assets Discovered

- Template compliance requires explicit categorization.
- The Type header becomes a governance signal tied to template selection.

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Amend CANON to require episode categorization and governed status.
- Update EPISODES.md to bind Type header to template category.
- Define episode categorization terms in VOCAB.

## The Insight

Governed episodes only work if each one declares its category and uses the matching template; this makes structure checkable and drift measurable.

**Status:** Episode categorization canonified.
