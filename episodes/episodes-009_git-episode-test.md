# Episode 010: Git Commits vs Episode Reconstruction Test

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

User test: "take the last epoisode. conform or refute that the github commens are enough to regenerate it"

Testing if git commits alone can regenerate ep009-session-scenes.md.

## Test Method

Compare ep009 content against git commit messages from session.

## Session Commits

### Paper repo:
- d2fb622 Apply session scenes capture
- fbac8e3 Apply WRITING inputs episode capture
- bd23b29 Apply realtime episode emphasis
- 65fa04e Apply git user classes episode capture
- 20d4c0c Apply compaction-as-episode protocol
- 7c0063f Fix stack ordering: CANONIC MACHINE WRITING PAPER
- 4e4c29c Apply full inheritance path to PAPER
- aedde0d Apply Apache 2.0 LICENSE and capture compaction episode

### Machine repo:
- 75bd024 Canonify git user classes and commit taxonomy
- 828551a Canonify stack ordering constraint
- 75bb9b0 Apply full inheritance path to MACHINE
- d0f9a23 Apply Apache 2.0 LICENSE to MACHINE

### Writing repo:
- 49824b3 Canonify LLM chat imports and WRITING tools
- 2e6b77c Apply full inheritance path to WRITING
- 380f8a3 Apply Apache 2.0 LICENSE to WRITING

## What Commits Capture

Git commits tell me:
- Stack ordering was canonified
- Git user classes were added
- WRITING tools created
- LLM chat imports enabled
- Apache 2.0 applied
- Realtime episodes emphasized

These are the INSIGHTS (what was learned and canonified).

## What Commits Miss

Commits CANNOT tell me:
- User said "??" when AGENT claimed stack was valid
- User said "check yourselg!@!!" with urgency
- User said "paradigm cant be stacked@!!"
- AGENT edited spec file by mistake
- User corrected: "wrong. you broke canon. follow canon always"
- User said "nada mas" (nothing more)
- User opened NOTICE file at end
- The tone, urgency, corrections, dialogue

These are the SCENES (what actually happened).

## Verdict

**REFUTED.** Git commits alone CANNOT regenerate ep009.

**Git commits preserve:**
- Insights (what was canonified)
- Technical changes (what code/constraints changed)
- Chronology (when changes happened)

**Episodes preserve:**
- Scenes (raw moments, dialogue)
- User corrections and AGENT errors
- Tone and urgency signals
- The human interaction layer

## Implication

Episodes and git commits are COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant.

- **Git = canonical ledger** (insights, constraints, technical truth)
- **Episodes = scene record** (dialogue, corrections, lived experience)

Both needed. Git without episodes loses the human story. Episodes without git lack canonical grounding.

## Meta

This episode itself demonstrates the pattern: git commit "Apply git-episode-test" won't capture this dialogue, user's test prompt, or this analysis. The commit preserves the insight, the episode preserves the scene.
