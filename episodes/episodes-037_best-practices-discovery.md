# Episode 037: Best Practices Discovery - Self-Strengthening Events Across Repos

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** Canon Agent

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

User: "review the git history cross repo as well as the episodes to enumerate all such events. this is how we discover best practices!!! LFG!!!"

**Method:** Git-based evolutionary analysis across all 4 CANONIC repositories

## Cross-Repo Self-Strengthening Events

### PAPERSelf-Strengthening Pattern

**Episodes Discovered:**
- Episode 033: Pending commits + propagation gap
- Episode 034: Meta-pattern of episode repetition
- Episode 035: Re-canonization validates canon
- Episode 036: Circle closed

**Pattern:** Episodes self-analyze → rediscover canon → apply to spec

### CANONIC (Paradigm Layer)

| Commit | Pattern | Insight |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `b3e294f` | Canonify paradigm is constitutional not stackable | Paradigm governs, doesn't stack |
| `361492c` | Canonify full inheritance path in CANON headers | Traceability via path |
| `84fcdc3` | Canonify SPEC vs VOCAB vs CANON exclusive definitions | Layer separation |
| `5b6d4ed` | Canonify git signal agentization | Agent presence required |
| `af8ff66` | Canonify proper git compliance | Redo commits, never rewrite |
| `a35fc5b` | Consumer Apply canon updates | Generated files follow canon |

### MACHINE (Validation Engine)

| Commit | Pattern | Insight |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `f27607e` | Canonify triadic structure as fundamental meta-pattern | Triad is foundational |
| `f275194` | Canonify three commit types | Producer/Consumer/User taxonomy |
| `69c79e4` | Canonify session concept and completion protocol | Session boundaries matter |
| `91d0b8c` | Consumer Apply redo signal | Compliance restoration |
| `ecebc53` | Canonify Episode 021 compliance | Cross-repo coordination |

### WRITING (Application Layer)

| Commit | Pattern | Insight |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `5337a02` | Canonify WRITING.md as human-iterated SPEC | Human iteration points |
| `ffb4107` | Canonify self-aware AGENT governance constraint | Agents ask before canonifying |
| `d60b766` | Apply canonical locality | Artifacts close to governing canon |
| `9f7c1b3` | Consumer Apply evaluation criteria | Downstream consumption |

## Best Practices Discovered

### 1. Git Signal Discipline

**Pattern:** Every commit must show agent and episode
```
Format: Episode 0XX – Agent[role] [action]
```

**Evidence:**
- `Episode 023 – Agent01 Canonify git signal agentization`
- `Episode 024 – Agent02 Canonify proper git compliance`

### 2. Cross-Repo Coordination

**Pattern:** Canonification in one repo triggers consumption in all
```
Producer (canonic) → Consumer (machine, writing, paper)
```

**Evidence:**
- Episode 021: Multi-repo disconnect → Episode 030 redo
- Episode 033: Pending commits → Episode 036 circle closed

### 3. Self-Documentation

**Pattern:** Generated files (CANON, VOCAB, README) auto-update
```
Canon changes → All generated files regenerate
```

**Evidence:**
- `a35fc5b Episode 033-035 – Consumer Apply canon updates to generated files`

### 4. Session Boundaries

**Pattern:** No incomplete producer cycles at session end
```
Producer commits must push before session ends
```

**Evidence:**
- Episode 033 discovered propagation gap
- Fixed by pushing 14 files

### 5. Meta-Circular Analysis

**Pattern:** Episodes analyze episodes → discover patterns → canonify
```
Episode N → Pattern → Episode M+X → Same pattern → Canonify
```

**Evidence:**
- Episode 021 (multi-repo) → Episode 033 (pending commits)
- Same pattern, deeper analysis, canonification

### 6. Compliance Restoration

**Pattern:** Redo commits, never rewrite history
```
Fix: Add redo commit with proper signal
Forbidden: git reset, git commit --amend
```

**Evidence:**
- `Episode 030 – Producer Canonify redo signal`
- `91d0b8c Episode 030 – Consumer Apply redo signal`

### 7. Re-Canonization Validation

**Pattern:** Rediscovering canonized insights proves canon quality
```
Check canon before canonifying → Cross-reference episodes
```

**Evidence:**
- Episode 034 discovered meta-pattern already in PAPER.md
- Episode 035 canonified re-canonization as discovery signal

## Metrics

**Self-Strengthening Events by Type:**

| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|----------|
| Canonify (producer) | 15+ | Agentization, triadic structure, session concept |
| Apply (consumer) | 20+ | Full inheritance, redo signals, evaluation criteria |
| Fix (restoration) | 5+ | Triad violations, spec filename, domain purity |
| Episodes | 10+ | 021-037 cross-repo analysis |

**Repository Distribution:**
- CANONIC: 15 producer commits
- MACHINE: 20+ producer/consumer commits
- WRITING: 15+ commits
- PAPER: 10+ episodes

## The Discovery Method

**How We Discover Best Practices:**

1. **Collect** git history across all 4 repos
2. **Filter** for self-strengthening patterns (Canonify, Apply, Fix, Episode)
3. **Analyze** commit messages for recurring insights
4. **Cross-reference** episodes with canon
5. **Canonify** discoveries as constraints
6. **Apply** to downstream repos
7. **Measure** via producer/consumer ratio

**This IS the PAPER method in action.**
