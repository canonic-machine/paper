# Episodes

**Narrative captures of PAPER writing sessions.**

This directory contains chronologically ordered episodes documenting the actual sessions where this PAPER was written. Each episode is an unprocessed narrative capture with storytelling voice, preserving the fleeting moments and emotional beats of discovery.

## Purpose

Episodes serve as:
- **Episodic memory** for the PAPER writing process
- **Drift tracking** showing AGENT learning evolution over time
- **Evidence source** for evolutionary analysis
- **Temporal VOCAB** capturing AGENT behavior patterns

## Structure

Each episode follows canonified structure:
- **Context**: Brief scene-setting (what's happening)
- **Session narrative**: Storytelling voice with direct quotes, emotional beats, "Click" moments

Episodes are governed (structured) but unprocessed (no concept extraction, no asset references, no analysis). Prose processes episodes.

## Indexing

Episodes are numbered sequentially:
- `ep001-constitutional-compliance.md`
- `ep002-vocab-reset.md`
- `ep003-paper-spec-violation.md`
- ...

## Evolution

Episode structure evolves with machine maturity. Early episodes may differ from later episodes - this is intentional. Structure writes itself through practice. Differences are preserved as drift signal.

## Usage

Read episodes chronologically to track AGENT understanding evolution. Sentiment frequency analysis reveals learning patterns ("Click", "??", "LFG", "brilliant").

Episodes are input to WRITING machine. Prose processes episodes into analyzed content for PAPER Results section.
