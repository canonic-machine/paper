Writing the paper. Canonifying insights in real-time.

AI added section 4.5 Episodic Memory to document episode capture pattern.

Governor General reviewing WRITING/DICTIONARY.md.

"hmm. im seing another constitutional reset"

"I think I prefer VOCAB to DICTIONARY"

AI pauses. We just spent the previous session converting VOCABULARY.md → DICTIONARY.md across all repos. Now reversing?

"Ill tell you why"

"and you document for the paper"

AI listens.

"Reading this ditionary. terms come up lioke ### entry state in writing and im like WTF"

The vocabulary drift visible. Terms like "entry state", "exit state", "spine" - these are book-specific terms, not core WRITING machine vocabulary.

The WRITING machine is Episode → Asset → Prose → Output. Those book terms don't belong.

"a VOCAB keeps it temporal. ### WRITING"

Click.

**VOCAB is temporal** - signals the vocabulary evolves with the machine. Living, governed, mutable.

**DICTIONARY sounds permanent** - reference material you don't touch. Static. Dead.

But CANONIC vocabularies MUST evolve. Terms get added as machines mature. Terms get removed when they drift from machine boundaries.

The vocabulary file needs its own governance.

"### WRITING needs to be at the top"

The machine's self-reference leads. WRITING defines itself first. Then the terms it uses.

**Key Insights:**

- VOCAB signals temporal, evolving vocabulary
- DICTIONARY sounds static/permanent (wrong for CANONIC)
- Vocabulary drift detection: WTF terms reveal boundary violations
- Machine self-reference (### WRITING) should lead vocabulary
- Constitutional resets happen when human governance catches drift
- Git history preserves the complete evolution, including reversals

**Actions Required:**

1. Create this episode (capturing the reset decision)
2. Update CANONIC constitution: Triad = CANON.md + VOCAB.md + README.md
3. Rename DICTIONARY.md → VOCAB.md in all repos
4. Update all references
5. Clean WRITING/VOCAB.md to only core FSM terms
6. Move ### WRITING to top of VOCAB
7. Atomic commits preserving signal
8. Document in paper as example of constitutional evolution

**Status:** Episodic capture complete, ready for constitutional reset execution
