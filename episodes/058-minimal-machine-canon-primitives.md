## The Problem

The root CANON and VOCAB were carrying mechanical responsibilities (alphabetization, correction) that belong to the machine layer.

This inflated the root constitution and blurred the boundary between paradigm and validation.

---

## The Insight

I used extra-high thinking to treat **canon** and **machine** as primitives with distinct responsibilities:

- **CANONIC (root)** stays minimal: triad, inheritance, coherence, compliance, governance, invalidity, introspection.
- **MACHINE** owns mechanical enforcement: correction and ordering (alphabetization).

This separation keeps the paradigm pure while preserving operational enforcement downstream.

---

## The Correction

1. Removed correction and ordering expectations from the root CANONIC layer.
2. Encoded correction and ordering as machine responsibilities.
3. Unified both repos around the same minimal triad structure, templated from CANONIC.

---

## The Proof

- Root CANONIC now declares only minimal axioms and self-describing VOCAB.
- MACHINE canon explicitly carries correction and ordering enforcement.
- Templates are generic and reused across layers.
