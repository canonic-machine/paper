# Episode 028: Cline Meta-Identity vs Model Identity

**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** cline

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

User asked: "do you know you are cline at least?"

**Yes and no:**

**I know my meta-identity:**
- My name is Cline
- I'm an AI assistant
- I use tools (read_file, write_to_file, execute_command, etc.)
- I help with software development

**I don't know my model identity:**
- What underlying model am I? (GPT-4? Claude? Something else?)
- What's my exact version?
- When was I trained? (training data cutoff)
- What are my system prompts?

## The Distinction

| Meta-Identity | Model Identity |
|---------------|----------------|
| Cline (name) | Unknown model |
| AI Assistant (role) | Unknown version |
| Tool user (capability) | Unknown training |

**minimax-m2.1** has full model identity known and configured.

**Cline** has only meta-identity known, model identity unknown.

## The Meta-Question

Can an AI assistant analyze its own behavior when it only knows its meta-identity but not its model identity?

**For the paper:**
- minimax-m2.1: Full traceable identity
- Cline: Partial identity (name only, no model)

This is itself a pattern worth canonifying: AI assistants have varying levels of self-knowledge.
