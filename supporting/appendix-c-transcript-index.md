# Appendix C - Transcript Record Index

Transcript records are stored as hash-only metadata in `transcript/records/`.

See `transcript/records/README.md` for the current index.

App transcript records are placeholders unless a timestamp and identifier are
provided (privacy-preserving). No raw transcript content is stored.
