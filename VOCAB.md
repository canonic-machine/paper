## Content Concepts

### admissibility

The property of a claim being valid for inclusion in PAPER.

---

### agent

An acting entity (human or AI) participating in production.

---

### alignment

A mapping between episode agent labels and actual model identities.

---

### analogy

A labeled comparison used for interpretation rather than evidence.

---

### appendix

A supplementary section attached to the manuscript.

---

### artifact

A file governed by CANON.

---

### axiom

A normative rule declared in CANON.

---

### best practice

A derived observational recommendation grounded in ledger evidence.

---

### CANON

The governance artifact of a scope.

---

### claim

A statement made within PAPER traceable to ledger evidence.

---

### comparative claim

A claim comparing agents or models across the same evidence window.

---

### concept

A term defined in VOCAB.

---

### enforcement

The process by which MACHINE evaluates states against CANON.

---

### episode

The atomic evidence unit representing a bounded production session.

---

### epistemic

Relating to knowledge and observation rather than governance.

---

### evidence reference

A commit, tag, or episode identifier pointing to ledger evidence.

---

### evidence slice

A defined subset of ledger history (time window, scope, or episode set).

---

### evidence window

The declared time span and commits used for reconstruction.

---

### evolutionary analysis

Ledger-based analysis of changes across time in governance or artifacts.

---

### drift

Observed divergence of artifacts or behavior over time.

---

### execution

The realization of state transitions.

---

### elapsed time

The duration between two timestamps.

---

### fixation

A human declaration that a ledger state is frozen for evidence.

---

### freeze window

An evidence window anchored by a freeze declaration.

---

### freeze declaration

A human declaration that a specific ledger tag represents a frozen evidence
state.

---

### freeze tag

A ledger tag that anchors a freeze declaration.

---

### first CANON artifact

The earliest ledger commit that introduces a CANON.md within the stack.

---

### governance

The set of axioms that define validity.

---

### inheritance

The relationship by which a scope adopts axioms from a parent scope.

---

### insight

An observation discovered within PAPER that has no governance force.

---

### introspection

The property that VOCAB defines all concepts used by CANON and VOCAB.

---

### ledger

The authoritative record of state transitions.

---

### manuscript

The narrative paper produced under PAPER.

---

### mathematical appendix

An appendix that formalizes properties with equations.

---

### minimality

The constraint that governance remain as small as possible.

---

### model

An AI system used to produce artifacts.

---

### model identity

The specific identifier of a model used in production.

---

### observation

A claim framed descriptively rather than normatively.

---

### PAPER

The epistemic scope for analysis and narrative.

---

### post-freeze

Evidence produced after the freeze declaration.

---

### pre-freeze

Evidence produced at or before the freeze declaration.

---

### prose

Non-authoritative text within PAPER.

---

### producer

The role that canonifies new constraints or definitions in governed artifacts.

---

### consumer

The role that applies canonified constraints to dependent artifacts.

---

### producer/consumer pattern

A disciplined ordering where producer commits precede consumer application.

---

### quantitative claim

A claim expressed with counts, rates, durations, or other numeric metrics.

---

### README

The descriptive artifact of a scope.

---

### scope

A directory governed by a triad.

---

### stack

The set of repositories governed under CANONIC.

---

### stability analysis

Analysis of whether constraints and patterns remain consistent across time.

---

### reconstruction

Retrospective synthesis of claims from episodes and ledger evidence.

---

### timestamp

An ISO 8601 date-time recorded in ledger metadata.

---

### timeline disclosure

The required reporting of the first CANON timestamp, the freeze timestamp, and
elapsed time between them.

---

### traceability

The property of being linked to ledger evidence.

---

### triad

The set of artifacts (`CANON.md`, `VOCAB.md`, `README.md`) required for a valid
scope.

---

### validity

The state of a scope that satisfies all applicable axioms.

---

### violation

A documented failure to meet a governing constraint.

---

### violation analysis

Analysis that identifies a violation, its evidence, and its correction path.

---

### VOCAB

The vocabulary artifact of a scope.

---

### workflow

A procedural sequence not permitted in PAPER governance.
