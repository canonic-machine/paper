## Core Concepts

### PAPER

A governed academic manuscript that codifies epistemic claims bounded by LEDGER evidence.

### epistemic

Relating to knowledge and justified belief. PAPER is epistemic-only: it records knowledge but does not govern behavior.

### epistemic-only

The constraint that PAPER records knowledge but does not govern behavior. Papers inform; CANON governs.

### evidence-bounded

The constraint that all claims in PAPER must trace to verifiable LEDGER evidence.

### ledger authority

LEDGER as the authoritative source for all evidence claims. PAPER cites; LEDGER proves.

### govern

To enforce normative rules. PAPER MUST NOT govern; it only records.

### claim

An assertion made in PAPER that MUST trace to LEDGER evidence.

### evidence

Verifiable data stored in LEDGER that supports PAPER claims.

### evidence window

The temporal and logical boundary within which claims are valid.

## Freeze Sequence

### freeze sequence

The three-phase immutability progression: IP freeze → publish freeze → ledger freeze.

### IP freeze

The first freeze marking the public/private boundary. Content remains editable.

### publish freeze

The second freeze when PAPER submits to external archive. Content becomes locked.

### ledger freeze

The final freeze when PAPER is versioned and immutable on chain.

### mutable

State before publish freeze where content can be modified.

### invariant

State after publish freeze where content cannot be modified.

---

## Supplemental

### supplemental

Material that supports PAPER but resides outside the main manuscript.

### supplemental separation

The architectural constraint that supplemental materials exist separately from manuscript. Supplemental proves; manuscript claims.

### Appendix

Supplemental containing math proofs and formal derivations.

### GitHub

The OS that serves as the supplemental archive. GitHub proves PAPER.
