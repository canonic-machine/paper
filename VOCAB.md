---

### evolutionary analysis

Ledger-based analysis of changes across time in governance or artifacts.

### living document

A paper that exists with continuous evidence integration across indefinite time.

### authoring mode

A valid approach to PAPER production under CANONIC governance.

---

### evolutionary mode

Authoring mode characterized by human-driven incremental refinement with low variance between versions.

---

### reconstitution mode

Authoring mode characterized by AI-assisted concept extraction from LEDGER with synthesis after capture.

---

### oscillation mode

Authoring mode that alternates between evolutionary and reconstitution modes based on evidence density.

---

### semantic paper versioning

Version numbering convention where v0.x indicates bootstrapping, v1.0 indicates first stable release, and vX.Y indicates evidence additions (minor) or restructuring (major).

---

### v0.n

A pre-release version describing findings as observations.

---

### v0.n+1

A subsequent version demonstrating features that were provisional in v0.n.

---

### multi-temporal authorship

Contribution pattern where authors (human or AI) contribute across non-contiguous time windows with ledger continuity.

---

The property that new evidence windows add claims while prior claims remain (per immutability).

---

### IP flow

---

### observations

---

### disclosures

Filed invention disclosures documenting patterns (IP flow stage 2).

---

### implementations

Deployed mechanisms based on disclosed patterns (IP flow stage 3).

### release

Public release of code or artifacts (IP flow stage 5).

### operational phase

The state of a PAPER after v1.0 declaration, indicating stable claims and complete implementation.

---

### gated release

Code or artifact release conditioned on prior patent filing (per IDF-069).

---

### axiomatic closure

The property that a set of axioms generates all valid patterns within a domain.

---

### atomic axiom

A necessary-condition axiom that cannot be removed without breaking a category of governance patterns.

---

### execution declaration

A communication pattern where AI declares intent and executes rather than seeking approval for governed actions.

---

### approval seeking

A communication pattern where AI requests permission before acting, appropriate for actions outside governance constraints.

---

### intensity encoding

Semantic information carried by character repetition count (e.g., "!" vs "!!!!").

---

### stateless production

AI artifact generation using ledger state instead of session memory, enabling cross-session continuity.

---

### execution

The realization of state transitions.

---

### elapsed time

The duration between two timestamps.

---

### fixation

A human declaration that a ledger state is frozen for evidence.

---

### freeze window
