The PDF layout contract (column count, margins, float spacing, and figure
rendering expectations).

---

### TYPESET.md

The typesetting specification artifact that defines PDF rendering details.

---

### two-column layout

A PDF layout with two text columns per page.

---

### vector figure

A figure rendered as vector graphics (for example, SVG or PDF).

---

### full-width figure

A figure that spans both columns in the PDF for legibility.

---

### legible figure text

Figure text that remains readable at the printed size.

---

### body font size

The font size used for normal manuscript prose.

---

### figure asset

A rendered figure file embedded in the manuscript.

A vector diagram rendered from Mermaid syntax.

---

### mermaid source

A source file containing Mermaid syntax used to generate a mermaid diagram.

---

### minimality

The constraint that governance remain as small as possible.

---

### model

An AI system used to produce artifacts.

---

### model identity

The specific identifier of a model used in production.

---

### observation

A claim framed descriptively rather than normatively.

---

The epistemic scope for analysis and narrative.

---

### post-freeze

Evidence produced after the freeze declaration.

---

### pre-freeze

Evidence produced at or before the freeze declaration.

---

### prose

Non-authoritative text within PAPER.

---

### producer

The role that canonifies new constraints or definitions in governed artifacts.

---

### consumer

The role that applies canonified constraints to dependent artifacts.

---

### producer/consumer pattern

A disciplined ordering where producer commits precede consumer application.
