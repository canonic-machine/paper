# STREAMS

Episode indexes organized by type.

## Governance Path

```

Inherits from: `/canonic/machine/os/writing/`

---

## Purpose

Streams index episodes by type. Stream indexes must reference episodes stored in `/writing/episodes/` and must not duplicate episode content. Streams inherit the epistemic role constraint from WRITING: they must not define governance.

---

## Scope

### In scope

- Episode indexing by type
- Episode reference management
- Channel classification (IDE, App, Unknown)

### Out of scope

- Episode content duplication
- Governance definition (inherited constraint)

## Triad

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [CANON.md](CANON.md) | Governance axioms (2 axioms) |
| [VOCAB.md](VOCAB.md) | Vocabulary definitions |
| [README.md](README.md) | This file (non-normative) |

## Inherited Constraints

From WRITING:
- **Epistemic role** (WRITING Axiom 1): Streams MUST NOT define governance
