# STREAMS (/canonic/machine/os/writing/streams/)

inherits: /canonic/machine/os/writing/

---

## Axioms

### 1. Structural role

Streams index episodes by type.

---

### 2. Reference-only

Stream indexes MUST reference episodes stored in /writing/episodes/.

Stream indexes MUST NOT duplicate episode content.

---

## Inherited Constraints

This scope inherits from WRITING:
- **Epistemic role** (WRITING Axiom 1): Streams MUST NOT define governance

---

**This CANON defines validity for the STREAMS scope.**
