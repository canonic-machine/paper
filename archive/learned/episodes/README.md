## Purpose

Learned episodes are derived artifacts that reference source episodes. Each learned episode must include ledger references, record channel and source references, and include transcript record IDs when available. Learned episodes must not include transcript content. When asserting a discovery, learned episodes must map the inception point to the earliest transcript record ID and stream reference.
