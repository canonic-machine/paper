## Context

During the v0.1 cohesion pass, we discovered two related insights that constitute
post-freeze IP and must be protected before public release.

---

## Discovery

### 1. PAPER as reproducible template

The PAPER is not just a report—it is a reproducible template.

The structure (Triad, inheritance, introspection, ledger-first evidence,
insight-law separation) can be instantiated by anyone:
- Fork the stack
- Define your own CANON
- Run your own freeze
- Produce your own self-evidencing paper

This makes CANONIC a framework for reproducible governed research, not just
a one-off experiment.

### 2. CANON evolution as measurable signal

CANON evolution itself becomes signal:
- Axiom count (compression over time)
- Vocabulary stability (term churn rate)
- Violation rate (governance catch rate)

These metrics are measurable across commits. Governance convergence is not
opinion—it is data.

Future systems can track their own convergence the same way, enabling
cross-system comparison of governance maturity.

---

## IP classification

Both discoveries are POST-FREEZE IP:
- Discovered during v0.1 publishing workflow
- Not present in frozen evidence window
- Require IDF and PROVISIONAL protection before v0.2 release

---

## Correction applied

Content was added to v0.1 manuscript, then immediately reverted when IP
classification was recognized. The v0.1 manuscript remains frozen-window-only.

---

## v0.2 scope

These discoveries will be included in v0.2 after:
1. IDF filing
2. PROVISIONAL filing
3. IP protection confirmation

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- This episode documents the discovery
- paper:manuscript.md revert (this session)
- patents/paper-draft/ - target scope for v0.2

---

## Notes

The publishing workflow continues to be a discovery engine. Every cohesion
pass surfaces insights that belong to the next cycle.
