## Context

A hypothesis emerged that concept discovery occurs in cloud-agent transcripts
and then drifts into CANON through subsequent canonification.

---

## Session narrative

The user proposed that concepts are first discovered through cloud-agent back
and forth, then migrate into CANON as constraints. We framed a demonstration
method: align transcript signals (ledger-linked sessions, positive control
markers) to subsequent canonification commits to measure discovery-to-canon
drift.

---

## Violations encountered

None.

---

## Corrections applied

None. This episode records the hypothesis and the intended evidence method.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- writing: working tree (episode creation)
- paper: working tree (manuscript update)

---

## Notes

The hypothesis depends on transcript-ledger alignment (ep130, ep133) and
explicit cloud/local provenance to segment discovery pathways.
