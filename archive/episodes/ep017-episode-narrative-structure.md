## The Session

User reviewing episode evolution.

User: "what is different about episode 1 and the latest. i intended them to be like episode 1. now they are more sterile. do you agree?"

AGENT: Yes - ep001 has narrative voice, context, scene-setting. Latest episodes are sterile bullet points.

User: "ok. lets define episodes a bit better now. they should be structured. just not processed. they are narrative and shoudl be cannonifieed as such. the compoaction canon is the raw text. so comopaction is raw. episodes are narrative. both are unprocessed by the machine. they go on to concept extraction and eventual compilation into structured prose. so lets update episodes to be structured. but unprocessed. check the vocab. be precise. the canonify the insightt"

## The Distinction

**Compaction (chat export):**
- Raw text
- Unprocessed dialogue dump
- Full conversation verbatim

**Episodes:**
- Narrative
- Structured (## Context, ## Session, etc.)
- Scene-setting, voice, context
- BUT: Unprocessed by MACHINE (no concept extraction, no analysis)

**Prose:**
- Processed episodes
- Concept extraction applied
- Analysis, synthesis
- References assets
- Structured specification

## Current VOCAB Issue

VOCAB defines:
- **episode**: "Raw, ungoverned human input"

But this is imprecise. "Raw" conflates with chat exports. Episodes are NOT raw dumps - they're narrative captures.

## The Insight to Canonify

Episodes are:
- **Narrative** (storytelling, scene-setting, voice)
- **Structured** (canonified sections: ## Context, etc.)
- **Unprocessed** (no MACHINE processing - no concept extraction, no asset references)

Episodes capture what happened AS narrative, not AS raw text dump.

Compaction/chat exports are truly raw. Episodes are narrative renderings of sessions.
