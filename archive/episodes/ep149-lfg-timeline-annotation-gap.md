## Context

An earlier LFG signal requested that stream-based discovery be used to improve
timeline resolution in the paper. The request drifted and was not enforced
immediately.

---

## Session narrative

The user noted that an LFG request to annotate the timeline figure with stream
discoveries was missed. We treated this as a positive-control enforcement gap
and recorded the correction: update the timeline to include discovery stream
annotations.

---

## Violations encountered

- Positive control (LFG) not enforced for timeline annotation.

---

## Corrections applied

- Annotated the paper timeline with discovery stream events.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- writing: working tree (episode creation)
- paper: working tree (timeline update)

---

## Notes

LFG signals are treated as explicit follow-through requirements.
