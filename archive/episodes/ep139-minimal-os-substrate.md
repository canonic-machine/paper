Minimal CANONIC OS substrate

## Metadata

- Date: 2026-01-13
- Episode ID: ep139
- Participants: Dexter Hadley, Codex (GPT-5)
- Model identity: gpt-5 (Codex CLI)
- Status: Resolved

## Context

We identified a best practice: treat CANONIC OS as a minimal, frozen operating
substrate for LLM execution. New WRITING and PAPER work should be instantiated
against a frozen OS so governance does not drift under the experiment.

---

## Session narrative

The user requested documentation of this insight and inclusion in the paper
with evidence. We added a manuscript section describing the OS as a frozen
substrate, and linked the claim to episode evidence from OS initiation and
minimality reporting.

---

## Violations encountered

None.

---

## Corrections applied

- Added an OS substrate section in the manuscript.
- Added evidence links to the OS initiation and minimality episodes.

## Notes

This episode records an operational best practice rather than a violation.
