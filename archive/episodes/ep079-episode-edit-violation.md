# Episode 079: Episode Edit Violation

**Date:** January 9, 2026
**Type:** Violation
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

---

## The Session

We attempted to correct episode drift by editing historical episodes to match a standardized format. This violated the canon that episodes are immutable records.

## Key Assets Discovered

- Episodes are immutable; corrections require new episodes (redo)
- Canon changes must not retroactively edit historical episodes

## Violations Detected and Fixed

**Violation:** Edited historical episodes to enforce a new standard.

**SWAT**
- **Strengths:** The intent was to align the archive with a clear standard.
- **Weaknesses:** It rewrote historical record and broke immutability.
- **Opportunities:** Use redo episodes to correct drift without editing past records.
- **Threats:** Loss of drift evidence and trust in the archive.

## Git Signal

- Commit `8062b2c` recorded the violation (episode edits).

## The Insight

Standardization must be enforced forward-only. Episodes are immutable; corrections live in new episodes and canon changes, never edits.

**Status:** Violation recorded; redo required.
