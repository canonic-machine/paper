Ep003 done. AI says "Episode 003 complete."

User opens PAPER.md.

"ok. im reading the PAPER spec. I dont agree"

"Out of scope: CANONIC paradigm details beyond what's needed to understand WRITING machine governance."

"The CANONIC WRITING MACHINE PAPER is about the entire stack. SO yes. the PAPER is the focus. but CANONIC WRITING MACHINE are semantic methods that we govern."

AI: Oh. Scoped too narrow.

"Specifically the PAPER is about the best practices for wreiting a CANONIC paper. we dont know them yet. We will analuze our CANONIC interactions with the GIT MACHINE. Productive and Consumptive. And come up with traceable and robust best practices. update the PAPER spec now and run the paper engine to sync to the constitution."

AI updates PAPER.md:
- Old: WRITING machine only
- New: Entire stack (CANONIC + WRITING + MACHINE)
- Purpose: Discover best practices (not document known ones)
- Method: Analyze git commits

"PAPER is also uppercase. its a SPEC"

AI: Oh. PAPER.md is a SPEC like CANONIC.md.

Commits:
- c274e36 Canonify PAPER scope
- cac252a Apply spec to regenerate CANON

Pushed to GitHub.

"you are still putting episides in WRITING. move them all to PAPER"

AI checks. ep003 still in writing/episodes/.

How?

AI copied episodes to paper, then git rm writing/episodes/. But ep003 was untracked. git rm only removes tracked files.

"and thats a meta insight"

"how did you miss that"

"canonify the fix"

AI removes: rm -rf writing/episodes/

"yes. we need detailed episodes for the paper"

AI writes detailed ep004.

"follow your own stack how to write it"

"I jsut give you the SPECs"
