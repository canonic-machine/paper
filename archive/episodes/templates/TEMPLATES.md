# EPISODES TEMPLATES

## 1. Purpose

Describe the use of templates for EPISODES within the WRITING scope.

Templates provide a suggested structural starting point for new episodes without defining meaning, behavior, or authority.

---

## 2. Scope

- Applies to `/canonic/machine/os/writing/episodes/templates/`.
- Inherits from `/canonic/machine/os/writing/episodes/`.
- Applies only to the creation of new episode files.

---

## 3. Normative language

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Statements using these key words are normative. Examples and suggested layouts are non-normative unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## 4. Principles

### 4.1 Structural guidance

Templates exist to suggest file structure and section ordering for EPISODES.

Templates do not convey semantic meaning or behavioral expectations.

---

### 4.2 Non-authority

Templates have no governance, enforcement, or interpretive authority.

Use of a template does not confer validity on an episode.

---

## 5. Constraints

- Templates **MUST** define structure only.
- Templates **MUST NOT** define governance, enforcement, interpretation, or workflow.
- Templates **MUST NOT** alter existing episode files.
- Templates **MAY** evolve over time without affecting previously recorded episodes.

---

## 6. Validation

An EPISODES TEMPLATES scope is valid if and only if:

- the triad (`CANON.md`, `VOCAB.md`, `README.md`) is present,
- templates are used only as non-authoritative structural guides, and
- no governance or interpretation is introduced through templates.

---

## 7. Consumption notes

- Templates are optional and advisory.
- Episodes remain valid regardless of template usage if they satisfy EPISODES CANON.
- Readers should treat templates as convenience artifacts only.

---

**This SPEC is descriptive and non-authoritative.**  
**Governance is defined exclusively by CANON.**
