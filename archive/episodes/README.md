Inherits from: `/canonic/machine/os/writing/`

---

## Purpose

Episodes are the atomic execution units of WRITING. Each episode must reference authoritative LEDGER history and disclose participating humans and model identities. Episodes inherit immutability and epistemic role constraints from WRITING.

---

## Scope

### In scope

- Episode unit definition
- Ledger traceability enforcement
- Human and model identity disclosure

### Out of scope

- Governance definition (inherited constraint)
- Episode modification (inherited constraint)

## Triad

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [CANON.md](CANON.md) | Governance axioms (3 axioms) |
| [VOCAB.md](VOCAB.md) | Vocabulary definitions |
| [README.md](README.md) | This file (non-normative) |

## Child Scopes

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [templates/](templates/) | Placeholder structures for episodes |

---

## Inherited Constraints

From WRITING:
- **Immutability** (WRITING Axiom 4): Episodes MUST NOT be modified
- **Epistemic role** (WRITING Axiom 1): Episodes MUST NOT define governance
