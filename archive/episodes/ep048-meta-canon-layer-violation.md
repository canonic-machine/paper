# Episode 048 – Meta-Canon Layer Violation and Resolution

**Meta-pattern discovery:** How layer violations are detected, reset, and canonified in the correct layer.
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** Canon Agent

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown

## What Happened

1. **Violation**: AI added AI/USER commit separation to CANONIC/CANON.md (root paradigm)
2. **Detection**: USER caught it: "wrong. root is pure paradigm. MACHINE is the git interface"
3. **Reset**: AI attempted `git reset --hard` to understand the violation
4. **Correction**: Committed explanation, then added constraint to MACHINE/CANON.md (correct layer)

---

## The Meta-Pattern

```
Layer violation detected → Reset to understand → Canonify in correct layer
```

**Step 1: Violation**
- Constraint added to wrong layer (paradigm vs implementation)

**Step 2: Detection**
- USER identifies layer mismatch
- Paradigm (CANONIC) ≠ Implementation (MACHINE)

**Step 3: Reset**
- `git reset --hard` to remove violation
- NOT for fixing - for UNDERSTANDING
- Must be followed by commit explaining why

**Step 4: Canonification**
- Constraint added to correct layer
- Consumer apply across all repos

## Layer Discipline Rules

**CANONIC (root paradigm)** - Contains:
- Fundamental governance principles
- Constitutional invariants
- Triad requirement
- Producer/consumer process
- Episode alignment

**NOT in CANONIC:**
- Git workflow patterns
- Implementation details
- Domain-specific rules

**MACHINE (validation engine)** - Contains:
- Git-FSM implementation
- Validation framework
- Commit patterns
- Agent behavior
- Git user classes

**CANONIC is what. MACHINE is how.**

## SWAT Analysis

### Strengths (What worked)
1. **USER caught violation** - Human governance detected layer mismatch
2. **Reset for understanding** - Not for fixing, but for learning
3. **Correct canonization** - Constraint now in MACHINE

### Weaknesses (What failed)
1. **AI added to wrong layer** - Confused paradigm with implementation
2. **Attempted fix without understanding** - First impulse was reset, not analysis
3. **Meta-violation loop** - Tried to add constraint, got caught, reset, tried again

### Opportunities (What could work)
1. **Pre-check layers** - AI asks "which layer?" before canonifying
2. **Layer validation** - Validator checks layer before accepting constraints
3. **Explicit layer tagging** - Constraints tagged as paradigm/implementation

### Threats (What could break)
1. **Onion confusion** - Layer 2 (MACHINE) patterns leaking to Layer 1 (CANONIC)
2. **Drift to implementation** - Paradigm becoming implementation guide
3. **Undetected violations** - USER not available to catch layer mismatch

## Canonification (This Episode)

**Pattern discovered:** Layer violation → Reset for understanding → Correct canonification

**Application:**
- When constraint seems paradigm-level, ask: "Is this fundamental governance or git workflow?"
- Git workflow = MACHINE
- Fundamental principles = CANONIC

**Evidence:**
- Episode 047 documents the original violation
- This episode documents the meta-pattern
- MACHINE/CANON.md contains the correct constraint
