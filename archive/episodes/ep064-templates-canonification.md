## The Session
We were correcting template drift: templates had become documentation instead of pure instantiation shells.

## Session narrative
The user called it out: templates were mixing documentation with canon, and CANONIC guidance was leaking into every template. The fix was to strip templates down to placeholders only and move template behavior into a dedicated TEMPLATE spec. That kept templates reusable while preserving canon rules in the right place.

## Resolution
- Rewrote all templates to placeholders only.
- Added a TEMPLATE spec to define template function and constraints.
