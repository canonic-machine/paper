## The Problem

CANONIC and MACHINE drifted after iterative edits: the triad was briefly broken, introspection did not explicitly span README, and enforcement language was mixed into axioms. Templates also implied root-only usage rather than being generic.

---

## The Insight

- **Minimal axioms:** CANONIC keeps only triad, inheritance, and introspection.
- **Literal introspection:** VOCAB must define every term used by CANON, SPEC, README, and itself.
- **Enforcement lives in SPEC:** MACHINE enforces axioms via evaluation, not by expanding CANON.
- **Templates are generic:** root CANON is just an instance of the template.

---

## The Correction

1. Canonified minimal CANONIC axioms and strict introspection that spans README.
2. Expanded VOCAB to satisfy literal token coverage.
3. Rebuilt MACHINE CANON as primitives (input, evaluation, decision, signal, determinism) and aligned MACHINE spec enforcement.
4. Updated templates to be scope-agnostic and reflect enforcement wording.

---

## The Proof

- CANONIC CANON is minimal and introspective across CANON/SPEC/README.
- CANONIC VOCAB defines all terms used by CANONIC CANON, SPEC, and README.
- MACHINE CANON defines primitives; MACHINE spec enforces CANONIC axioms and machine enforcement.
- Templates no longer assume root-only usage.
