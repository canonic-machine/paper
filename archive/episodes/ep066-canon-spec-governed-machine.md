## The Session
We were clarifying what constitutes the core of a shippable CANONIC machine.

## Session narrative
The question sharpened into a clean line: if CANON and SPEC are preserved, can they faithfully reproduce a governed CANONIC machine? The answer landed as a simple yes—SPEC encodes the generation method and CANON encodes the axioms, so VOCAB and README can be regenerated and MACHINE can enforce the constraints. We started to formalize that as a SWAT, then paused when the episode template reminded us to keep episodes unprocessed and narrative-only. The insight still stood, but we kept it as story instead of analysis.
