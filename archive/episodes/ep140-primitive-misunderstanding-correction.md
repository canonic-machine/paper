## Context

We discussed whether CANONIC OS is a primitive. The correct framing is that OS
is a scope/layer (operating substrate), while the primitives remain the seven
governance primitives listed in the manuscript.

---

## Session narrative

The user asked if the OS substrate is a primitive. I clarified that OS is not a
primitive; it is the operating substrate scope that must remain minimal and
frozen. The paper was updated to explicitly declare the OS substrate anchor in
the evidence window and to treat OS as a stable layer rather than a primitive.

---

## Violations encountered

- Misclassification of OS as a primitive (scope vs. primitive confusion).

---

## Corrections applied

- Clarified OS as a scope/layer in narrative.
- Declared the OS substrate anchor in the evidence window.

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- paper:df2cda8

---

## Notes

This episode records a taxonomy correction: primitives define governance
invariants, while OS defines the execution substrate.
