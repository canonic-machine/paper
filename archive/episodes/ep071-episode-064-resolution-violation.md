## The Session
We were still walking through the recent episodes to identify non-canon sections.

## Session narrative
Episode 064 included a Resolution block that summarized changes as if it were a postmortem. That drifted into processed content, which episode canon forbids. This episode documents the mistake without adding analysis beyond the narrative of catching it.
