# Episode 084: Thinking Instability

**Date:** 2026-01-09

## The Session

We observed instability in direction during scope decisions (introduce tuning, then remove it as non-minimal). The session surfaced that the shifts themselves need to be recorded as evidence, and the paper should evolve from episodes rather than adding new governance layers.

## Key Assets Discovered

- Decision volatility creates churn; documenting reversals keeps governance traceable.
- The paper stays minimal by keeping episodes in `paper/episodes/` and removing superfluous scopes.

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Remove the `tuning/` repo.
- Restore episodes to `paper/episodes/` and update PAPER/CANON/VOCAB references.

## The Insight

Recording direction instability as an episode preserves the rationale for reversals and keeps the paper grounded in lived governance, not extra layers.

**Status:** Instability documented; tuning removed.
