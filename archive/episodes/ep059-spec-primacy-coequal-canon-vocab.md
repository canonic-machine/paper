## The Problem

The paradigm needed a clear statement that SPEC is the first artifact and that CANON/VOCAB are co-equal derivatives. The earlier change risked ambiguity and non-atomic git signal.

---

## The Insight

- **SPEC is primary**: human-directed source of truth.
- **CANON and VOCAB are co-equal**: both derive from SPEC and must cover its terminology.
- **VOCAB spans CANON and SPEC** without becoming a separate axiom beyond introspection.

---

## The Correction

1. Canonified SPEC primacy and co-equality in CANONIC.
2. Folded SPEC coverage into the introspection axiom.
3. Updated VOCAB to define co-equality and remove redundant SPEC coverage term.
4. Committed atomically to preserve git signal.

---

## The Proof

- CANONIC SPEC now declares primacy and co-equality.
- CANON introspection spans CANON, SPEC, and VOCAB.
- VOCAB definitions align with the new relationships.
