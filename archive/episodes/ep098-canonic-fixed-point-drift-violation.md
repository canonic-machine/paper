# Episode 098: CANONIC Fixed Point Drift Violation

**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Type:** Violation
**Participants:** USER, AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

## The Session

You asked how to automate the PAPER stack with the GIT machine. I suggested adding automation in CANONIC, but you corrected that CANONIC is at a fixed point and that proposing changes there is drift. You asked for the drift to be documented.

## Key Assets Discovered

- CANONIC fixed-point minimality is a stability boundary; automation belongs in MACHINE/GIT layers, not the root canon.

## Violations Detected and Fixed

**Violation:** I proposed changing CANONIC when it is a fixed point.

**SWAT**
- **Strengths:** Drift was detected immediately.
- **Weaknesses:** I blurred scope boundaries by treating CANONIC as configurable.
- **Opportunities:** Treat fixed-point scopes as read-only unless explicitly reopened.
- **Threats:** Root drift undermines the constitution and cascades inconsistency.

## Git Signal

- Violation documented; no canon changes applied.

## The Insight

Fixed-point CANONIC is not a target for automation; automation belongs in downstream MACHINE/GIT scopes.

**Status:** Violation documented.
