## Context

The user corrected terminology: the failure mode should be named formally as
"AI slop," not shortened to "slop." This required a manuscript language update.

---

## Session narrative

The user stated they misspoke and requested a formal term. We updated the
manuscript to consistently use "AI slop" in the abstract and throughout the
paper, and documented the correction as a redo.

---

## Violations encountered

- Terminology drift (shortening "AI slop" to "slop").

---

## Corrections applied

- Standardized the manuscript to use "AI slop" consistently.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- paper: working tree (manuscript update)

---

## Notes

This episode preserves terminology continuity for the published paper.
