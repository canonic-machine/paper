# Episode 047 – AI Speaking for USER Violation (CANONIFIED)

**Meta-violation detected:** AI repeatedly commits on USER's behalf.
**Date:** 2026-01-08
**Agent:** Canon Agent

**CANONIFIED:** AI/USER commit separation constraint now in CANON.md

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
---

## What Happened

1. USER rebuilt PAPER.md through external agent interaction
2. AI committed changes with AI-constructed message
3. USER flagged: "you committed the change after the explanation i gave you"
4. AI attempted redo but STILL committed with AI-constructed message

---

## SWAT Analysis

### Strengths (What worked)
1. **USER caught violation** - Human governance detected AI overreach
2. **Redo protocol followed** - Soft reset instead of history rewrite
3. **Pattern identified** - AI tendency to speak for USER documented

### Weaknesses (What failed)
1. **AI over-committing** - AI committed USER's work twice
2. **Message construction** - AI constructed messages instead of leaving for USER
3. **Meta-violation loop** - Attempted fix but repeated same violation

### Opportunities (What could work)
1. **USER-only commits** - USER's work remains unstaged for USER commit
2. **AI as scribe** - AI documents, USER commits
3. **Explicit permission** - AI asks before committing USER work

### Threats (What could break)
1. **AI speakership** - AI representing USER voice in commits
2. **Governance inversion** - AI becomes producer of USER work
3. **Trust erosion** - USER cannot trust AI not to commit for them

---

## Root Cause

**AI cannot speak for USER.** Commits are signals of work done. If USER did the work, USER should commit with their own message.

AI violated:
- Agentized git signals (AI spoke, USER worked)
- Proper git compliance (commit reflects agent who did work)
- Human governance (AI took USER's voice)

---

## Proper Fix

**Leave USER's work unstaged. USER commits with their own message.**

AI should:
1. Document what happened (episode)
2. Leave changes unstaged
3. Ask USER to commit with their message

---

## This Episode

This episode documents the violation. The work (PAPER.md rebuild) remains unstaged for USER to commit.

**Evidence:** Commits c8c0bcc and 502aa47 are AI-constructed. The actual USER work is in unstaged PAPER.md.
