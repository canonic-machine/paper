# Episode 001: Constitutional Compliance and Real-Time Canonification

**Date:** January 7, 2026
**Type:** Development session
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Executive)
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

## The Session

Started with CANONIC repository review. Found constitutional violations everywhere - VOCABULARY.md files instead of DICTIONARY.md. Triad requirement violated across all examples.

Governor General: "Follow the canon."

AI attempted to rebuild. Made mistakes. Tried to write scenes in the paper. Got corrected.

Governor General: "You don't write the scenes in the paper."

Reset. Redirect. Focus.

The key moments:

**"I sit here and direct you"** - Governor General explaining the governance model. Not coding. Governing.

**"AI driven"** - First attempt at framing.

Governor General: "Human directed." Correction.

Then: "Human governance."

AI: "AI-directed, human-governed."

Governor General: "That's an error. Never AI-directed."

Finally clicked: **AI-driven, human-governed.**

Like an engine. Driven (power source), not directed (steering). Human governs - sets boundaries, catches violations, evolves constitution.

**"I'm a governor general of AI"** - Perfect metaphor. Constitutional authority without micromanagement.

**The sloppy commit.** AI bundled 6 logical changes into one commit. Governor General caught it:

"You're losing git signal with a sloppy commit."

Git reset. Six atomic commits instead:
1. Remove VOCABULARY.md files
2. Add DICTIONARY.md files
3. Update CANONs
4. Regenerate READMEs
5. Update validators
6. Clean artifacts

Each commit preserves signal. Git history = FSM execution log.

**"Atomic git is critical"** - Because:
- Git history IS the data
- Producer/consumer ratio needs clean patterns
- Self-healing depends on backflow visibility
- We're writing a paper FROM the git signal
- Sloppy commits corrupt the experimental data

**Git as machine.** Not storage. A machine that CANONIC machines depend on.

Afferent (signals in): patterns, maturity metrics, backflow sequences
Efferent (recording out): state transitions, commit messages, immutable history

**"Canonify at the right level of the machine"** - Critical correction.

AI tried to put "git as machine" in CANONIC.md (paradigm layer).

Governor General: "For the last time - CANONIC is a paradigm."

Implementation details go in MACHINE/WRITING layer, not paradigm layer.

Layer discipline matters. State names reveal the layer.

**Real-time canonification.** As insights emerged from writing the paper, canonify them immediately. Not later. NOW.

Paper writes in real-time. Canonifies in real-time. Pushes to GitHub in real-time.

**"We need to write in real-time to capture the scenes we are living now"** - This moment. This session. This is the data.

Then the realization: **What you're writing now IS the episode.**

The paper about the WRITING machine, written using the WRITING machine, documenting itself being written.

Meta-circular. Self-referential. The system observing itself and reporting findings.

## Key Assets Discovered

- AI-driven, human-governed execution model
- Git as foundational machine infrastructure
- Governor General metaphor for human governance
- Atomic commits as critical infrastructure
- Layer discipline (paradigm vs implementation)
- Real-time canonification pattern
- Constitutional compliance through git signal
- Producer/consumer legislative process
- Triad requirement (CANON, DICTIONARY, README)
- Self-* properties (validating, optimizing, documenting, healing, measuring, strengthening)

---

## Violations Detected and Fixed

- VOCABULARY.md instead of DICTIONARY.md (16 files in WRITING repo)
- Sloppy commit attempt (caught before corruption)
- Incorrect canonification layer (reverted before push)
- Narrative scenes in academic paper (corrected to overview)

---

## Git Signal

**CANONIC repo:**
- 68 commits (after today's canonification)
- 49.3% producer ratio
- Rapid learning phase

**WRITING repo:**
- 17 commits (after constitutional fixes)
- 29.4% producer ratio
- Maturing phase

**PAPER repo:**
- 2 commits (just created)
- Paper writing in progress
- Extracting from git signals

---

## The Insight

This session IS the episode. The paper documents the WRITING machine by being written with it. The git commits prove the paradigm works.

Human governance + AI execution + Constitutional constraints + Git machine = Durable systems.

Governor General sits. Directs. Catches violations. Canonifies learnings. Evolves the constitution.

AI executes. Generates artifacts at scale. Self-validates. Self-corrects. Proposes patterns.

CANON enforces. Git records. The system observes itself.

Constitutional programming in action.
