## The Session
We were in the PAPER episodes when the user stopped me and said I was breaking canon by editing or adding episodes out of sequence. The instruction was to leave what I had done and follow the episode canon going forward.

## Session narrative
The pause was sharp: "episodes are frozen." I acknowledged the break and asked how to proceed. The response came back: "leave what you have done. you need to follow the episode canon. and generate a new episode to investigate how you generated an episode out of canon." The moment landed like a reset—document the drift, but do it within the canon, and keep the story unprocessed.
