## Context

The manuscript showed a structural drift where the Evidence window section was
interrupted by a non-evidence figure ("From single scope to multi-repo"). This
perforated the evidence window and weakened section anchoring.

---

## Session narrative

The user flagged the structural drift and requested an episode. We moved the
multi-repo figure out of the Evidence window, inserted section lead-in/outro
lines for continuity, and updated PAPER and CANON to require section continuity
and anchoring of figures to their intended headers.

---

## Violations encountered

- Evidence window section was interrupted by a non-evidence figure.
- Section continuity (intro/outro) was inconsistent in the manuscript.

---

## Corrections applied

- Reordered the multi-repo figure to its own section, preceding the Evidence
  window.
- Added explicit section lead-ins and follow-through lines.
- Added section continuity requirements in PAPER and CANON.

## Notes

This episode codifies section continuity as a governed constraint.
