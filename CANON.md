# CANON (paper/)

**Inherits from:** [canonic-machine/writing](https://github.com/canonic-machine/writing)

## Paper Constraints

### Subject
**This paper documents the CANONIC WRITING machine.**

The paper explains:
- 4-state FSM (Episode → Asset → Prose → Output)
- AI-driven, human-governed writing
- Git as underlying machine dependency
- Constitutional writing governance

**Violation:** Paper documents CANONIC paradigm instead of WRITING machine

### Evidence Source
**All claims must trace to git history.**

Evidence from:
- WRITING repository commits
- Producer/consumer patterns
- FSM state transitions
- Constitutional violations and recoveries

**Violation:** Claims without git history evidence

### Structure
**Standard academic paper structure required.**

Sections:
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Model/Architecture
- Implementation
- Results/Evaluation
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- References

**Violation:** Missing required sections or non-standard organization

### Traceability
**Every artifact reference must resolve.**

All links, citations, examples must be verifiable.

**Violation:** Broken links, hallucinated references, unverifiable claims

### Key Insights Required

**The paper must document these insights:**

- Git is a machine that CANONIC machines depend on (not just storage)
- AI-driven, human-governed execution model (governor general metaphor)
- Atomic commits as critical infrastructure (FSM execution log)
- Layer discipline (paradigm vs implementation)
- Real-time canonification pattern
- Producer/consumer legislative process
- Constitutional compliance through git signal
- Triad requirement (CANON, VOCAB, README)
- VOCAB is temporal (evolves with machine, not static dictionary)
- Self-* properties (six introspective properties)
- Every session is an episode (meta-circular writing)
- Episodes captured in real-time during sessions (episodic memory)

**Violation:** Missing key insights, insights without git evidence
