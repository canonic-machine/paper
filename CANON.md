## Paper Constraints

### Subject
**This paper documents the entire CANONIC MACHINE WRITING PAPER stack.**

CANONIC (paradigm), MACHINE (validation engine), WRITING (application), PAPER (use case).

Purpose: Discover best practices for writing CANONIC papers through realtime episodes capturing AGENT interactions with GIT MACHINE.

Method: Capture episodes in realtime, analyze productive/consumptive git commits to extract traceable, robust best practices.

**We don't know best practices yet - the paper discovers them through git analysis.**

**Violation:** Paper claims to already know best practices, paper documents only WRITING machine without paradigm context, paper documents only paradigm without machine context

### Evidence Source
**All claims must trace to git history from actual CANONIC paper writing sessions.**

Evidence: PAPER repository commits, WRITING repository commits, CANONIC repository commits, producer/consumer patterns, episodes, violations and recoveries, maturity metrics from git log.

**Violation:** Claims without git history evidence, hallucinated references, unverifiable assertions, theoretical speculation

### Structure
**Standard academic paper structure required.**

Sections: Abstract (best practices contribution), Introduction (AI slop problem, CANONIC stack solution), Model (CANONIC paradigm), Implementation (WRITING + GIT MACHINE interactions), Results (best practices discovered), Discussion (what works, what fails), Conclusion (best practices summary), References.

**Violation:** Missing required sections, non-standard organization, claims best practices without analysis

### Traceability
**Every artifact reference must resolve.**

Repository links exist on GitHub. Commit hashes exist in git history. File paths exist at specified commits. Git commands produce stated results. Metrics computable from git log. Episodes trace to actual sessions.

**Violation:** Broken links, hallucinated references, unverifiable claims, commands that fail, fabricated episodes

### Key Insights Required

**Paradigm layer (CANONIC):**
- Constitutional programming via constraints + validation
- Triad requirement (CANON, VOCAB, README - LLM-generated)
- VOCAB is temporal (evolves with machine)
- Specifications are human iteration points
- Producer/consumer legislative process
- Inheritance

**Machine layer (GIT MACHINE):**
- Git is a machine (not storage)
- Atomic commits as critical infrastructure
- GitHub is the ledger
- Git signal = FSM execution trace
- One episode spans many commits

**Governance:**
- AI-driven, human-governed execution
- Constitutional compliance through git signal
- Human governance catches AI drift
- Real-time canonification

**Application layer (WRITING + PAPER):**
- 4-state FSM (Episode → Asset → Prose → Output)
- Episodes are ungoverned input (fleeting moments)
- Canonical locality (artifacts near governing canon)
- Self-* properties

**Best practices (discovered through git analysis):**
- Every session is an episode
- Form vs governance (file existence ≠ compliance)
- Layer discipline
- Meta-circular writing

**Violation:** Missing insights, insights without git evidence, insights not organized by layer

### Episode Constraints

**Episodes are unprocessed INPUT to the WRITING machine.**

Episodes are narrative captures of sessions. Structured, but unprocessed (no MACHINE processing - no concept extraction, no analysis, no asset references).

**Canonified episode structure:**
- ## Context (brief - what's happening)
- ## Session narrative (storytelling, scene-setting, voice - what happened, what was said)
- Narrative voice like ep001 (scene recreation, emotional beats, "Click" moments)
- Direct quotes preserved with context
- Optional sections IF canonified

**Episodes must be:**
- Unprocessed (no MACHINE processing - no concept extraction, no analysis)
- Narrative (storytelling voice, scene-setting, context)
- Structured (canonified sections)
- Chronologically ordered
- Fleeting moments preserved

**Episodes must NOT be:**
- Processed by MACHINE (no asset extraction, no concept analysis)
- Sterile bullet points (should have narrative voice)
- Written as mini-papers with AI-invented "Key Insights" sections

**Violation:** MACHINE processes episodes (extracts concepts, analyzes), episodes lack narrative voice, AI invents structure without canonification

**Rationale:** Episodes are Episode state (unprocessed). Asset extraction happens in Asset state. Prose processes episodes. Episodes preserve narrative voice for human interrogation of AGENT comprehension.

### Meta-Circular Properties

**The paper IS the experiment.**

Paper documents best practices for CANONIC papers. Paper is itself a CANONIC paper. Paper discovers best practices by analyzing its own writing. Paper validates claims against its own git history.

**Violation:** Paper describes patterns it doesn't demonstrate, claims not validated against own git history, paper doesn't analyze its own commits
