### 1. Publication Lifecycle

Papers MUST follow the lattice lifecycle:

```
DRAFT → DISCLOSE → PATENT → PUBLISH → ADVERTISE
D∩T     D∩T∩R      D∩E∩T∩R∩O  D∩E∩T∩R∩O∩S  repeat
```

---

### 2. Version Series

```canonic
v0  CANONIC     D∩T        Draft governance axioms
v1  LANGUAGE    D∩E∩T      Add formal specification
v2  APPSTORE    D∩E∩T∩R    Add distribution boundary
v3  BLOCKCHAIN  D∩E∩T∩R∩O  Add enforcement layer
```

Each version advertises next without leaking IP.

### 3. Freeze Sequence

```
IP_FREEZE      → marks public/private boundary
PUBLISH_FREEZE → submit to archive (locked)
LEDGER_FREEZE  → versioned immutable
```

---

### 4. Patent Integration

```
v0 → IDF-001, IDF-002 → PROV-001, PROV-002
v1 → IDF-003          → PROV-003
v2 → IDF-004          → PROV-004
v3 → IDF-005          → PROV-005
```

PATENT before PUBLISH. Always.

### 5. Evidence Bounded

Claims MUST trace to LEDGER evidence.

---

### 6. Supplemental Separation

Main paper MUST NOT contain supplemental.
GitHub IS the supplemental archive.
