# CANON (paper/)

**Inherits from:** [canonic-machine/writing](https://github.com/canonic-machine/writing)

**Generated from:** PAPER.md

## Paper Constraints

### Subject
**This paper documents the CANONIC WRITING machine, not the CANONIC paradigm.**

The WRITING machine is a 4-state FSM: Episode → Asset → Prose → Output.

Focus: 4-state FSM, AI-driven human-governed writing, git as machine dependency, constitutional governance, episodes/assets/prose/output states.

**Violation:** Paper documents CANONIC paradigm instead of WRITING machine implementation

### Evidence Source
**All claims must trace to git history.**

Evidence from WRITING repository commits, CANONIC repository commits, producer/consumer patterns, FSM state transitions, constitutional violations and recoveries, maturity metrics from git log.

**Violation:** Claims without git history evidence, hallucinated references, unverifiable assertions

### Structure
**Standard academic paper structure required.**

Sections: Abstract, Introduction, Model, Implementation, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References.

**Violation:** Missing required sections or non-standard organization

### Traceability
**Every artifact reference must resolve.**

Repository links must exist on GitHub. Commit hashes must exist in git history. File paths must exist at specified commits. Git commands must produce stated results. Metrics must be computable from git log.

**Violation:** Broken links, hallucinated references, unverifiable claims, commands that fail when executed

### Key Insights Required

**The paper must document these insights extracted from git history:**

- Git is a machine that CANONIC machines depend on (not just storage)
- AI-driven, human-governed execution model (governor general metaphor)
- Atomic commits as critical infrastructure (FSM execution log)
- Layer discipline (paradigm vs implementation vs domain)
- Real-time canonification pattern (insights captured during execution)
- Producer/consumer legislative process (maturity measurement)
- Constitutional compliance through git signal (violations visible, recoverable)
- Triad requirement (CANON, VOCAB, README - all LLM-generated)
- VOCAB is temporal (evolves with machine, not static dictionary)
- Self-* properties (self-validating, self-documenting, self-healing, self-measuring, self-optimizing, self-strengthening)
- Every session is an episode (meta-circular writing)
- Episodes captured in real-time (fleeting moments, episodic memory)
- Episodes are ungoverned input (may be messy, contradictory, incomplete)
- GitHub is the ledger (single source of truth, consumed to compute local metrics)
- One episode spans many commits (producer + consumer sequences)
- Canonical locality (artifacts placed closest to canon that governs them)

**Violation:** Missing key insights, insights without git evidence

### Meta-Circular Properties

**The paper demonstrates every pattern it describes.**

The paper documents the WRITING machine, is written using the WRITING machine, captures episodes from its own writing sessions, canonifies insights discovered during writing, validates claims against git history.

**Violation:** Paper describes patterns it doesn't demonstrate, claims not validated against own git history
