## PROTO-CANONIC ORIGIN

This CV documents the academic lineage that led to CANONIC:

```
2003-2007: PhD Genomics & Computational Biology (Penn)
           → GenomicPython ledgered with thesis (2007)
           → GitHub didn't exist yet (launched April 2008)

2013:      Stanford research (PI: Atul Butte)
           → Finally added GenomicPython to GitHub
           → https://github.com/iDrDex/GenomicPython

2026:      CANONIC.GENOMICS
           → CANONIC is closure
```

23 years from PhD start to CANONIC closure.
