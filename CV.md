- 2017 – 2019: Main organizer and presenter for 'NVIDIA day' at ICHS which served as a bridge between UC Berkeley and UCSF to foster cross institution collaboration in biomedical research

### MENTORING SUMMARY

My laboratory is particularly geared to mentoring combined MD, PhD candidates who seek to make a translational impact in the clinic. We leverage resources such as our NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) funded STARGEO.org web application to estimate robust signatures of disease genomics from which they can propose novel biomarkers or drug repositioning strategies for disease. We expose medical students to hands on data acquisition in the clinics to collect patient data with apps that feed our self–learning models of clinical intelligence. We provide our students and post-docs with many opportunities to publish their clinical and/or basic science research in peer–reviewed journals, and we encourage medical students to present their work at medical/scientific conferences around the world. Finally, we offer ample opportunities for mentoring and professional networking that may illustrate alternative careers in medicine for trainees to pursue that drive innovation in health care and embrace translational research.

## RESEARCH AND CREATIVE ACTIVITIES

### RESEARCH SUMMARY

The Hadley Laboratory at UCF translates big data into precision medicine and digital health. Our work generates, annotates, and ultimately reasons over large multi-modal data stores to better characterize disease. We develop state-of-the-art data driven models of clinical intelligence that drive clinical applications to more precisely screen, diagnose, and manage disease. We integrate multiple large data-stores to identify novel biomarkers and potential therapeutics for disease. The end point of our work is rapid proofs of concept clinical trials in humans that translate into better patient outcomes and reduced morbidity and mortality across the disease spectrum.

### CLINICAL TRIALS

- **NCT05384912 (PI):** Crowdsourcing an Open COVID-19 Imaging Repository for AI Research. The objectives of this project are to (1) assemble a crowdsourced, de-identified radiographic repository; and (2) train and validate existing COVID-NET deep learning diagnostic models.

- **NCT06604078 (PI):** Breast Cancer AI Imaging Study. This study aims to develop a social health platform called MammoChat (https://MammoChat.com) that allows patients to share their real-world patient data to a trusted network for development of clinical intelligence to improve patient outcomes.

- **NCT06631105 (PI):** Capability Assessment for Diet and Activity (CADA) Model for Diabetes. This study investigates the capabilities related to diet, physical activity, screening, and knowledge among diabetic adults with or without a history of hospital admissions in Central Florida on patient outcomes.

## CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE

As a faculty member of UCF, I am building a research laboratory in close collaboration with HCA Healthcare with a goal to translate the growing stores of clinical and research data into new drugs, diagnostics, and insights into disease. My laboratory integrates multi-modal sources of both open and closed data across the gamut of available 'omics' and imaging technologies to define disease pathology and identify potential clinical interventions. The endpoint of my work is rapid proofs of concept clinical trials across the drug and digital spaces to reduce the burden of disease in patients. Towards this end, I have focused my scientific inquiry thus far into three specific areas:

**1. Developing digital curation methods for large-scale clinical data.** I develop methods to curate large and diverse clinical data stores. I developed the NIH-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource (stargeo.org) web application and paid medical students over $100K to use it to crowd-source the curation of digital samples of functional genomics data to facilitate large-scale screening for biomarkers and candidate drug repositioning across the disease spectrum. Using these crowd-sourced labels, I developed NIH-funded NLP curation techniques to scale and automate the curation of STARGEO.org and other large-scale datasets. Moreover, I'm developing NLP curation to curate patient notes to assemble large-scale clinical imagesets for deep learning. I've also developed mobile apps that collect clinical data and imaging for deep learning.

**2. Large-scale characterization of risk factors for complex disease.** My background is in genomics and computational biology, and my early work focused on design and analysis of studies to prioritize genetic risk factors for complex disease. However, I have always had a translational focus on copy number variants (CNVs), and I contributed to PennCNV, one of the original algorithms to call CNVs from GWAS results. As a student and a post-doc, I was exposed to all aspects of GWAS, including assay development to detect CNVs by PCR as well as sample recruitment for studies in complex diseases like autism and age-related macular degeneration.

**3. Translating genomic discoveries into clinical interventions.** I have made significant translational discoveries across the neuropsychiatric disease spectrum working at the Center for Applied Genomics at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia which houses the largest academic pediatric biobank in the world with over 300,000 genotyped samples and associated with EMRs. I was able to learn production scale genomics, and the intricacies of maintaining a large biobank. In addition to characterizing the disease genomics of a number of disorders with both genotyping and sequencing, my work has resulted on an ongoing 'precision medicine' clinical trial for ADHD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02286817).

## OTHER CREATIVE ACTIVITIES

### SkinIQ (SkinIQ.co)
My laboratory has collected clinical images of skin lesions in collaboration with the Department of Dermatology at UCSF and training deep learning algorithms to improve the precision of clinical screening and diagnosis of skin cancer. We were funded by the UCSF Marcus Program in Precision Medicine to develop these algorithms, and we provide non-commercial access to make predictions of images of skin lesions through this web portal.

### STARGEO.org
I personally built the Search Tag Analyze Resource for the Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to facilitate interpretation of disease gene signatures using open Big Data in functional genomics. The NIH funded STARGEO.org through the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) program as pioneering Massively Open Online Laboratory. STARGEO.org is actively being used by scientists today to translate open Big Data into translational drug and biomarker discoveries.

### MammoChat.com
I have been spearheading a patient portal where patients can download and share their breast imaging for research. This resource is mandatory to acquire a diversity of patient data on which I test the precision mammography deep learning algorithms that my laboratory has been developing. NIH had funded this research along with gifts of technology from a number of partners including Western Digital, Nautilus Medical, ClusterOne, NVIDIA, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform.

### Fzero Genomics (fzerogenomics.com)
I have been spearheading the first large genomics effort focused on mapping the ancestry of Caribbean-derived people. Founded in Trinidad and Tobago, Fzero is a personal genomics company developing an online experience for customers to explore their continental ancestry with break-through DNA genotyping technology, which achieves over 99.9% accuracy. We are developing the F0 Genomics Ancestry Test that uses DNA extracted from saliva samples to deliver personalized reports of continental ancestry to our customers. Mapping the ancestry represents the first step towards finding precision medicine in Caribbean populations that have been relatively neglected in genomics research thus far.

## PROTO-CANONIC ORIGIN

This CV documents the academic lineage that led to CANONIC:

```
2003-2007: PhD Genomics & Computational Biology (Penn)
           → GenomicPython ledgered with thesis (2007)
           → GitHub didn't exist yet (launched April 2008)

2013:      Stanford research (PI: Atul Butte)
           → Finally added GenomicPython to GitHub
           → https://github.com/iDrDex/GenomicPython

2026:      CANONIC.GENOMICS
           → CANONIC is closure
```

23 years from PhD start to CANONIC closure.
