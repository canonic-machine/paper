# PAPER

The epistemic scope for analysis and narrative.

---

## Overview

PAPER provides a space for observations, insights, and claims traceable to ledger evidence. It has no governance authority beyond its own validity.

Supporting materials live in `paper/supporting/` and provide descriptive appendices without adding governance.

## Build

Run `./scripts/build_pdf.sh` (requires `pandoc` and a LaTeX engine).

### Output

- `output/manuscript.pdf` — typeset PDF
- `output/manuscript-full.md` — combined markdown (manuscript + appendices)

---

## Triad

- `CANON.md` — governance axioms
- `VOCAB.md` — content concept definitions
- `README.md` — this file
