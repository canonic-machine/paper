## Purpose

PAPER reconstructs, analyzes, and narrates system evolution from ledger evidence. It is epistemic only—observing and reconstructing execution without prescribing, enforcing, or governing.

---

## Scope

### In scope

- Manuscript production from ledger evidence
- Epistemic reconstruction of governed execution
- Evidence-based claims with IDF citations
- Evolutionary arc documentation (Axiom 29)
- Describe-then-demonstrate versioning

### Out of scope

- Constitutional axioms (governed by root)
- Enforcement mechanics (governed by MACHINE)
- Execution boundaries (governed by OS)
- Episode production (governed by WRITING)

## Key Concepts

- **Epistemic-only**: PAPER observes; it does not govern
- **Ledger authority**: All claims traceable to evidence
- **Describe-then-demonstrate**: v0.n describes; v0.n+1 demonstrates
- **Bifurcation**: System closure leads to commercialization (VaaS) or open source (CANONIC)

- `CANON.md` — 29 axioms
