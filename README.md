# CANONIC WRITING Machine Paper

**Academic paper documenting the WRITING machine: AI-driven, human-governed writing through constitutional constraints.**

---

## Overview

This repository contains an academic paper about the CANONIC WRITING machine.

**Subject:** The 4-state FSM (Episode → Asset → Prose → Output) that enables governed writing at scale

**Evidence:** Git history from the WRITING repository

**Target:** ArXiv submission (cs.SE - Software Engineering)

## Governance

This paper follows CANONIC programming principles:

- **Inherits from:** [WRITING machine](https://github.com/canonic-machine/writing)
- **Evidence:** Git history analysis
- **Traceability:** All claims verifiable
- **Self-documenting:** Generated from constraints

---

## Progression

1. **Paper** (this repo) - Academic paper about WRITING machine
2. **Book** (future) - Expanded treatment based on paper

Both written using the WRITING machine they document.

---

## Meta

This paper practices what it preaches:
- Written using CANONIC WRITING machine
- Git history proves the approach works
- Self-documenting structure
- Constitutional governance throughout
