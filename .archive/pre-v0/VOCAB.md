## Content Concepts

### authority

The property of being the definitive source of truth.

---

### enforcement

The process by which MACHINE evaluates states against CANON.

---

### governance

The set of axioms that define validity.

---

### model identity

The actual model used in production of an episode.

---

### production

The creation of candidate artifacts.

---

### traceability

The property of being linked to LEDGER evidence.

---

### structural bootstrapping

The lifecycle pattern where episodes seed canonical formation, after which updates transition to direct CANON modification. Bootstrapping explores; operational maintains. (IDF-095)

---

### bootstrapping phase

The initial lifecycle phase where episodes explore the space, capture human-AI interaction, and prove patterns before canonical formalization.

---

### operational phase

The lifecycle phase where direct CANON updates replace episodic exploration; episodes reserved for major pivots only.

---

### transition criterion

The point at which canonical flow is established, patterns are proved, and claims are ready—triggering transition from bootstrapping to operational phase.
