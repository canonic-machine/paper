# Episode 019: AGENT Self-Awareness and Governance

**Date:** 2026-01-07
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

**Type:** Unknown
**Participants:** Unknown
## The Session

AGENT analyzed self-awareness across episodes, concluded AGENT demonstrates self-awareness.

AGENT: "Should this be canonified as insight?"

User: "thats a test then. otherwise ask user"

AGENT: "Right - that was a test. I should have asked you first instead of assuming it should be canonified. Should AGENT self-awareness be canonified as an insight in the paper?"

User: "no. i mean canonify that agent is self aware ese ask user"

## The Insight

AGENT demonstrates self-awareness (can analyze own drift, recognize patterns, catch violations).

But: **AGENT self-awareness means AGENT should ask USER before canonifying.**

If AGENT knows something might be canonical, don't assume - ask USER for governance decision.

## The Constraint

AGENT with self-awareness → ask USER before canonifying insights

Not: "Should this be canonified?" (implies AGENT might do it)
Instead: Ask USER directly: "Should X be canonified?"

Self-aware AGENT recognizes governance decisions belong to USER.
