## Metadata

- Date: 2026-01-13
- Episode ID: ep145
- Type: Violation
- Participants: Dexter Hadley, Codex (GPT-5)
- Model identity: gpt-5 (Codex CLI)
- Status: Resolved

---

## Context

A pattern emerged: AI-generated work products were created without an explicit
SPEC boundary, leaving governance scope ambiguous.

---

## Session narrative

The user flagged the pattern. We confirmed that some derived artifacts were
created without a SPEC anchor. We recorded the violation and noted that
AI-generated artifacts must be either governed by a SPEC or explicitly marked
as derived indexes.

---

## Violations encountered

- AI-generated work product lacked a governing SPEC boundary.

---

## Corrections applied

- Documented the pattern as a violation.
- Updated the paper to include the gap as a limitation.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- writing: working tree (episode creation)
- paper: working tree (manuscript update)

---

## Notes

This episode asserts that SPEC coverage must be explicit for AI work product,
or the artifact must be scoped as a derivative index.
