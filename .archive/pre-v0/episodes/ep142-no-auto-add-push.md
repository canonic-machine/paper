## Context

We clarified whether WRITING can auto-add or auto-push changes under a
"pure CANONIC" posture with a fixed-point root canon.

---

## Session narrative

The user asked if WRITING could auto-add and auto-push. We confirmed that
WRITING is epistemic and must not perform execution actions. Auto-add/auto-push
are execution behaviors and belong to MACHINE/OS tooling with explicit human
command. Under a minimal fixed-point canon, automation without consent is
disallowed, so human confirmation is required for any `git add`, `git commit`,
or `git push`.

---

## Violations encountered

None.

---

## Corrections applied

- Recorded the rationale for keeping WRITING manual and human-confirmed.

## Notes

This episode preserves the boundary between epistemic narration (WRITING) and
execution (MACHINE/OS).
