## Context

A pattern emerged where figures drifted into the wrong section. The Triad
section showed a governance loop figure, and the Evidence window section was
interrupted by the multi-repo figure, breaking section anchoring.

---

## Session narrative

The user flagged the drift and requested an episode. We reviewed the manuscript
structure, identified misplaced figures, and realigned them to their correct
sections. We moved the triad closure figure into the Triad section, relocated
the governance loop to its own header, and moved the multi-repo figure outside
the Evidence window. We then updated PAPER and CANON to codify section anchoring
rules so the pattern is governed going forward.

## Violations encountered

- Figures were not anchored to their intended section.
- The Evidence window section was interrupted by a non-evidence figure.
- The Triad section lacked a Triad-specific figure.

---

## Corrections applied

- Reordered figures and headers in the manuscript to align each figure with the
  section it illustrates.
- Added section anchoring requirements to PAPER and CANON.

## Notes

This episode establishes figure anchoring as a governed constraint to prevent
section drift.
