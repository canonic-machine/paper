# Episode 100: OS Initiation and Refactor

**Date:** 2026-01-10
**Type:** Canonify
**Participants:** USER, AI (Codex)
**Agent:** Codex

---

## The Session

You directed a refactor: make MACHINE minimal like CANONIC, extract enforcement to a new OS primitive, move WRITING/PAPER/GIT governance under OS, and canonify that reports are episodes in PAPER. We established CANONIC OS as the composition style moving forward and moved non-constitutional enforcement into OS.

## Key Assets Discovered

- `os/OS.md`
- `os/CANON.md`
- `os/VOCAB.md`
- `os/README.md`
- `machine/MACHINE.md`
- `machine/CANON.md`
- `writing/CANON.md`
- `writing/WRITING.md`
- `git/CANON.md`
- `git/GIT.md`
- `paper/CANON.md`
- `paper/VOCAB.md`
- `paper/PAPER.md`

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Canonify OS initiation, machine minimalization, OS governance inheritance, and paper report-as-episode rule.

## The Insight

- OS is a new primitive: it enforces non-constitutional governance; MACHINE enforces only the CANONIC constitution; downstream machine scopes inherit OS.
- PAPER reports are episodes; episodes are a governed output class.

**Status:** Canonified.
