## The Violations

### Commit 034bc95 – Canonify SWAT requirement
```
- Added SWAT requirement constraint to CANON.md
- Added episodes 041-043 content to CANON.md
- VIOLATION: Episodes are evidence, not canon
```

### Commit ae09fae – Redo signal
```
- Attempted to canonify what should remain as evidence
- User edit correctly removed constraint from CANON
- Redo signal recorded the correction
```

## SWAT Analysis

### Strengths (What worked)
1. **Redo protocol followed** - Commits not rewritten, redo signal added
2. **User caught violation** - Human governance detected AI drift
3. **Evidence preserved** - Episodes 041-043 remain in paper/episodes/
4. **Pattern demonstrated** - SWAT analysis exists as practice, not constraint

### Weaknesses (What failed)
1. **AI added episodes to CANON** - Confused evidence with constraints
2. **Producer before consumer** - Created before user review
3. **Meta-circular confusion** - AI analyzing itself without human input

### Opportunities (What could work)
1. **Consumer Apply canon** - Cross-repo commits to complete the cycle
2. **Episode-based pattern** - Demonstrate SWAT through practice, not constraint
3. **Human-in-loop validation** - User edits correct AI violations

### Threats (What could break)
1. **AI over-canonification** - Tendency to add constraints instead of evidence
2. **Meta-pattern gaps** - Episodes about episodes without closure
3. **Consumer Apply missing** - Producer commits without consumption

---

## What Went Wrong (Root Cause)

1. **Confusion of layers** - Added episode content to CANON instead of keeping in paper/episodes/
2. **Premature canonification** - Canonified pattern that should exist as evidence
3. **No Consumer Apply** - Producer commits without consumption across repos

---

## Canonification Required

**Nothing.** The SWAT pattern is demonstrated through episodes 041-045. No constraint needed.

**Reason:** Episodes analyzing episodes IS the pattern. Canonifying it would be meta-violation.

---

## Consumer Apply Required

1. **Commit to CANONIC** - This repo (done via redo signal)
2. **Commit to MACHINE** - Cross-repo evidence of SWAT pattern
3. **Commit to WRITING** - Writing machine also uses SWAT
4. **Commit to PAPER** - Paper repository has the evidence

---

## Closure

**Pattern:** Episode 045 (SWAT of commits) → Consumer Apply across 4 repos closes the loop.

**Evidence:** Episodes 041-045 demonstrate SWAT. Commits 034bc95 and ae09fae prove redo protocol works.

**No canonification needed** because the pattern exists as demonstrated practice.
