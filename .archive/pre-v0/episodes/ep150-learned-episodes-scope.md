Learned episodes scope and stream coverage

## Metadata

- Date: 2026-01-13
- Episode ID: ep150
- Type: Governance decision
- Participants: Dexter Hadley, Codex (GPT-5)
- Model identity: gpt-5 (Codex CLI)
- Status: Resolved

## Context

The user required that automated discovery episodes live in a separate derived
scope and that every interaction across streams be curated to back claims or
disclosures.

---

## Session narrative

We agreed to keep primary episodes immutable and create a learned scope for
derived episodes at `writing/learned/episodes/`. We also recorded the coverage
expectation: claims and disclosures should be backed by curated stream evidence.

---

## Violations encountered

None.

---

## Corrections applied

- Created the learned scope and learned episodes triad.
- Recorded the stream coverage requirement as a best-practice pattern in PAPER.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- writing: working tree (learned scope added)
- paper: working tree (best-practice update)

---

## Notes

Learned episodes are secondary artifacts and must not overwrite primary
episodes.
