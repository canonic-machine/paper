## The Session
We were auditing episode canon compliance after the user asked for a SWAT analysis and then reminded us that episodes are unprocessed and frozen.

## Session narrative
I added a SWAT section and Resolution to Episode 066 in response to the request, then removed them when the episode template requirement was pointed out. That edit violated the rule that episodes should not be processed or revised in that way. This entry documents the misstep as a narrative record, keeping the correction within the episode canon.
