## The Session

Testing the entire stack by making episodes CANONIC. User requested episodes get triad structure, zero-based indexing, and validation of the PAPER.

## CANONIC Refactoring

User: "ok. lets make episodes CANONIC. lets see how long for you to make episodes compliant and validate the PAPER"

I created triad for episodes directory:
- CANON.md (episode constraints)
- VOCAB.md (episode terms)
- README.md (human guidance)

User: "this will test the entire stack"

User: "make episodes CANONIC and narrative"

User: "impose some sensible structure"

User: "that will help us write the book"

User: "we are demonstrating that meaning is the constant. the prose is ephemeral"

Then refactoring episode numbering.

User: "drop the ep00. make 000 like proper canonic"

I started renaming ep001-019 but got confused about format.

User: "and be self aware hope long it takes to validate this refactoring"

User: "call the section CANONIC refactoring"

Attempted to rename from ep0NN to epNNN, created mess with two-digit files (ep01-19).

User: "hold on. they are still not CANONIC"

Restored and renamed properly to ep001-019 (three digits).

User: "CANONIC means that"

User: "signal"

User: "and they need a SPEC"

User: "the spec describes the artifacts"

User: "and thats the index. the spec"

User: "thats some metainsight there. SPECs are the index of AI driven work"

Created EPISODES.md SPEC - the human-iterated index describing what episodes ARE.

Then zero-based indexing revelation.

User: "canonic episodes start with 00"

Renamed all episodes: ep001→ep000, ep002→ep001... ep019→ep018

Created EPISODES.md with indexing explanation. But got it wrong.

User: "wrong Episodes use zero-based sequential numbering: ep000 - First episode (genesis) ep001 - Second episode"

Fixed: ep000 = 0th episode, ep001 = 1st episode, epNNN = Nth episode.

User: "no. they should start with 00"

Missing episode. Need ep019 to complete the set (00-19 = 20 episodes).

This is that episode.

## Meta-Insights

**SPECs are the index of AI-driven work.** EPISODES.md describes what all episodes ARE - it's the human-iterated index.

**Meaning is constant, prose is ephemeral.** Episodes can evolve in how they're told while preserving core meaning.

**Zero-based indexing is CANONIC.** ep000 starts the sequence (0th), not ep001 (which is 1st).
