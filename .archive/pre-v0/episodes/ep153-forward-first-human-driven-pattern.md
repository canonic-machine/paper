## Context

The user clarified that discovery patterns are human-driven and that the agent
must follow after the human leads. Learned episodes should project patterns
from primary episodes to automate transcript ingestion.

---

## Session narrative

We recorded the "forward-first" principle: human signals precede agent action.
The agent should detect patterns in primary episodes and then apply the same
pattern to automate transcript ingestion in learned episodes.

---

## Violations encountered

None.

---

## Corrections applied

- Recorded the human-driven discovery pattern and its automation requirement.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- writing: working tree (episode creation)

---

## Notes

This principle is descriptive and keeps automation downstream of human
initiative.
