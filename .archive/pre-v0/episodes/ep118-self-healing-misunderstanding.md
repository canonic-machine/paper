# Episode 118: Self-Healing Discovery - Misunderstanding Corrected

**Date:** 2026-01-11
**Type:** Discovery
**Participants:** Human (Governor General), AI (Cline)
**Agent:** Cline

---

## The Session

Human asked about "human-first" meaning. I explained my misunderstanding: I conflated "human-first governance" with "human-only tasks." Human corrected: "all CANONIC is human-first, not human work."

## The Discovery

**Self-healing in action:**
1. AI made incorrect interpretation
2. Human caught the error
3. AI analyzed the misunderstanding
4. The system detected and can correct its own cognitive drift

**The misunderstanding:**
- I heard "human-first" and concluded "AI must not create episodes"
- Correct understanding: "Human-first governance means humans govern, but AI operates as agent under that governance"

**Why the error occurred:**
- Pattern matching: looked for "AI must not X" rules
- Ep052 "human-only constraint moved to PAPER" reinforced this
- Missed the distinction: governance model vs. exclusion

## The Fix

Canonify a constraint that clarifies "human-first" meaning:
- Human-first = governance by humans
- Human-first ≠ AI exclusion from producing artifacts
- AI produces, human governs and approves

## Git Signal

- `paper` - ep117 documented GIT self-healing
- `paper` - ep118 documents AI misunderstanding self-healing (this episode)
- `os` - axiom 7 canonified: human-first clarifies governance model vs exclusion

## Status

Fixed; canonified in OS axiom 7.
