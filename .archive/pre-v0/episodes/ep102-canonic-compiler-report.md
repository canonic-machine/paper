## Key Assets Discovered

- `os/OS.md`
- `os/CANON.md`
- `writing/WRITING.md`
- `paper/PAPER.md`
- `git/GIT.md`

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Report recorded as an episode.

## The Insight

- CANONIC defines the paradigm and minimal constitution; compilation begins when constraints are translated into enforceable rules in downstream layers.
- MACHINE is the minimal constitution engine; it does not add policy, it executes the constitutional form.
- OS is a compiler: it converts constitutional constraints into enforcement protocols and governance checks for machine scopes.
- WRITING is a compiler: it turns constrained inputs into governed artifacts under OS enforcement.
- PAPER is a compiler: it compiles episodes and git traces into interpretable claims, then canonifies discovered constraints.
- GIT is a compiler: it compiles governance actions into a ledgered execution trace that is auditable and replayable.

**Status:** Report complete.
