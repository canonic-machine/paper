## Context

The user required explicit coverage: interactions that support claims or
disclosures must be captured as episodes and indexed in the relevant streams.

---

## Session narrative

We recorded the coverage requirement as a best-practice pattern in PAPER and
as a reconstruction principle in STREAMS so claims remain traceable without
publishing transcripts.

---

## Violations encountered

None.

---

## Corrections applied

- Recorded the coverage requirement in PAPER.
- Recorded the coverage requirement in STREAMS.
- Scheduled reindexing of stream tables after new episodes.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- paper: working tree (manuscript best-practice update)

---

## Notes

Coverage ensures claims and disclosures remain reconstructable while keeping
transcripts confidential.
