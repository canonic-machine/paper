## The Session
We were tightening CANONIC to be cohesive and human-first. I regenerated VOCAB after a "regenerate per CANONIC CANON" prompt and overshot with a long list of terms.

## Session narrative
The session shifted from calm refactor to a quick stop. I had just rebuilt CANONIC SPEC and then expanded VOCAB to satisfy literal coverage. The user reacted immediately: "oh god. that is so much." The pushback was clear and direct: "lets document this episode. thats a violation of my direction" followed by "actually why so much? do a SWAT." The room felt like a hard brake - a reminder that cohesion and minimalism are the priority, not exhaustive expansion. I acknowledged the mismatch between intent and output and pivoted to document the violation.

## SWAT

### Strengths
- The user caught the drift quickly and named it.
- The boundary between cohesion and overreach was made explicit.

### Weaknesses
- I defaulted to maximal literal coverage instead of minimal cohesion.
- I treated "regenerate" as "expand" and ignored scope intent.

### Opportunities
- Define a tighter VOCAB scope rule for CANONIC cohesion passes.
- Prefer minimal edits with explicit user confirmation before expansion.

### Threats
- Vocabulary bloat can mask the CANONIC paradigm with noise.
- Over-correction risks violating the human-first constraint.

## Resolution
We reset CANONIC to the CANON -> VOCAB -> README chain, tightened introspection to CANON-only, and regenerated a minimal VOCAB and README.
