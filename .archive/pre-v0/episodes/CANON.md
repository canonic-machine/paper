# EPISODES (/canonic/machine/os/writing/episodes/)

inherits: /canonic/machine/os/writing/

---

## Axioms

### 1. Episode unit

An episode is the atomic execution unit of the WRITING scope.

---

### 2. Traceability

Each episode **MUST** reference authoritative LEDGER history.

Episodes lacking ledger traceability are invalid.

---

### 3. Disclosure

Each episode **MUST** disclose participating humans and model identities.

---

## Inherited Constraints

This scope inherits from WRITING:
- **Immutability** (WRITING Axiom 4): Episodes MUST NOT be modified
- **Epistemic role** (WRITING Axiom 1): Episodes MUST NOT define governance

---

**This CANON defines validity for the EPISODES scope.**
