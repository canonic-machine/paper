## The Session

You pressed on how SPEC functions as the human source of truth when it is not mentioned in the root CANON. We clarified the end-to-end flow: SPEC is the human input layer that self-defines its purpose, scope, and constraints; CANON is the minimal enforceable projection derived from SPEC; VOCAB defines CANON terms; README is the local narrative that can restate SPEC without changing constraints. This resolved the confusion about where SPEC "lives" and why it does not appear in the root CANON.

## Key Assets Discovered

- `canonic/CANONIC.md` (SPEC self-definition)
- `canonic/CANON.md` (minimal enforceable axioms only)
- `canonic/VOCAB.md` (CANON-closed terms)
- `canonic/README.md` (local narrative)

## Violations Detected and Fixed

None.

## Git Signal

- Insight recorded as an episode.

## The Insight

- SPEC is self-defining and human-first; it spans CANON by generating it, but it is not required to be CANON-closed.
- CANON remains minimal and does not mention SPEC; README is the local narrative that can restate SPEC without altering constraints.

**Status:** Insight recorded.
