## Context

The user requested a CANON clause to require supporting materials (Appendix
A-F) whenever the manuscript is updated.

---

## Session narrative

We added a PAPER CANON axiom requiring `paper/supporting/` and Appendix A-F to
remain present when the manuscript is updated, ensuring supporting materials
are closed over the latest manuscript state.

---

## Violations encountered

None.

---

## Corrections applied

- Added a supporting materials axiom to PAPER CANON.

---

## Evidence references (LEDGER)

- paper: working tree (CANON update)
- writing: working tree (episode creation)

---

## Notes

This keeps appendix coverage aligned with manuscript updates without expanding
PAPER governance beyond scope validity.
