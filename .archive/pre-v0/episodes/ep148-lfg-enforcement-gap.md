## Context

The user noted that an earlier "LFG" signal was issued, the conversation
briefly drifted, and then returned. That creates a risk of leaving positive
control signals unenforced.

---

## Session narrative

We treated "LFG" as a positive control that must trigger follow-through. We
audited WRITING episodes for explicit LFG markers and confirmed the existing
cases (ep002, ep037) are followed by recorded action. We recorded this as a
signal enforcement gap to ensure future LFG signals are explicitly closed out.

---

## Violations encountered

- Positive control signal issued without explicit enforcement tracking.

---

## Corrections applied

- Audited WRITING episodes for LFG markers.
- Recorded the enforcement requirement for future LFG signals.

within the recorded session.
