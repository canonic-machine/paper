# WRITING

The scope defining production of candidate artifacts through human-AI collaboration.

Inherits from: `/canonic/machine/os/`

## Purpose

WRITING defines the production of candidate artifacts only. Episodes serve as the atomic unit of bounded production sessions, traceable to LEDGER evidence. The scope enforces structural bootstrapping: episodes explore during bootstrapping phase, then transition to direct CANON updates once patterns are proved.

## Scope

### In scope

- Episode creation and management
- Model identity disclosure
- Ledger traceability
- Redo signal patterns for corrections
- Learned episode constraints
- Structural bootstrapping lifecycle

### Out of scope

- Governance definition
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Authority definition
